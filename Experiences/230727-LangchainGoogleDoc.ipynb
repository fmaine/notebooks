       " 'CONCERNING THE GOOD USE OF THE TAROT ',\n",
       " 'On the nature of the Tarot, some understand rather little and others too much. Scholars sometimes see in them a perpetual almanac, a forecasting and sometimes a course in morals, on metaphysics, on alchemy, a game, the simple fantasies of a playing card maker, an occult pact or a gift. Their comments, both gratuitous and hostile, finally provoke a genuine desire not to speak of Tarot in more profound terms, outside a certain framework, within certain limits. ',\n",
       " 'But the simple fan of tarot or rather, if I can call him - the reader -, there is no doubt, while he handles his cards, turns them over and shuffles them, he is convinced that he is witnessing the real development of things, of which he has only seen the surface up to now, as if he had placed a readable translucent paper onto the keys to the world, no matter what hidden events are suddenly revealed in his face, in his imaginations, in his particular reasoning, the tarot occupies that place, as in the times, of the Augur and Sibyl, from the three-foot pedestal, the sensitive young virgin, almost sleepwalking - sometimes the maid, this young girl – like in the times of Mesmer informs the whole family every night about the origin of evil, the passages through hell and the treatment of joint pain. ',\n",
       " 'I. THE ARCANA AND THE LAW OF SPECIALTY ',\n",
       " 'The Tarot constitutes a language, of which we are only given the alphabet. This alphabet comprises seventy-eight cards that appear as cryptograms or hieroglyphs. At first glance they present something evident and mysterious at the same time; something naive, but subtle. One sees in them a high priest, a crayfish, the sun and the moon, a juggler, a hanged man. It is an alphabet, where each letter - as we sometimes wish, totally in vain however – seem already to have their meaning. However, the outcome, the literary produce, of this language vanishes as soon as it is formed; through very different genres of play, some of whom are called; Grand jeu, Petit jeu, Tirage Moyen, Grand Tirage, Accomlissement, and all the rest. ',\n",
       " 'On one hand, the tarot is nothing more than a common playing card game - just as French is a somewhat more evolved version of Latin, or Malay a primitive form of Malagasy. It is disputed, without great evidence, what purpose the early Tarot served. The fact is that both applications served the same purpose: either for the pure and simple gaming, for the prize or for the winnings - in some places it is the game of Lombard or the game of Tarrochino, and in others places Piquet or the Imperial game, or finally for the inquiry into one’s destiny. ',\n",
       " 'From the game to the inquiry, every kind of mixture one can imagine. The player stuck in the café, shaking in front of his cards, throwing a sideways glance, and later, shouting out: “Only the scoundrels have any luck!” (the scoundrel being his adversaries), or: “Decidedly, the good Lord himself is against me!” He is concerned with winning a round of drinks. He questions the Gods and desires to shame them. ',\n",
       " 'Since the use is the same, the cards are analogous; the same courts, kings, queens (or ladies), jacks (in the tarot, equipped with horses). The same numbered cards; ace, two, three, four, and so on up to ten. The \"suits\" are here simply; Clover, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades, and in tarot; Clubs, Coins, Cups and Swords. However, there is a more noticeable difference too. Those are the twenty-two Major Arcana - they are also called “Trumps” of the Tarot, which outrank, in gameplay, any other card and in card divination they indicate the greater intentions of destiny. This is not an abnormal or surprising difference. Linguists usually distinguish between synthetic and analytical language. They surmise that it is common to see an analytic language return to synthesis or synthetics, towards analysis by reason of the law of specialty. This is why in French someone would say plus pur, where in Latin with a single word one would say purior or á l\\'amour as appose to in Latin just amori, and de l\\'arbre instead of arboris. From, to or more are called exponents. They are used on most of the old nouns, adjectives or adverbs, which have been extracted from the old common language and now endowed with an active force. ',\n",
       " 'Likewise, as with the Major Arcana, in the current playing cards, each suit can become a Trump. It depends, on the game, on the player’s luck during a round or the decision of the player - who at the price of a concession, gets a winning round in the game. However, in Tarot, the Trumps form a separate branch. They do not depend on any suit. They are provided with names and numbers. In other words, they are beyond exponents, each one seems to mark, going forward, as happen with the prepositions, its particular nuance and in the whole, a common intention. ',\n",
       " 'II. DISORDER AND METAMORPHOSIS ',\n",
       " 'What is the intention? If I look patiently at these unique pictograms, what amazes me above all, is their diversity. It would seem that everybody has been called in to collaborate here, as well as all mythologies. (How are they to be understood?) That Devil accompanied by two little devils, that final Judgment, with its blowing trumpet and the resurrection of the bodies, come directly from Christianity, but, the Popess? Here there is an air of blasphemy. On the other hand, some say, she is Isis on her knees, with the great book of nature (which she is not reading); behind her an extended vail. Also, the Wheel of Fortune, with its Sphinx, its monkey and its dog, refer to Egypt. However, Cupid, Strength, the triumphal Chariot evokes in us the Greeks and the Romans. There are more precious references too, the crayfish (or cancer), the twins, Pleiades, obviously refer to astrology. The Pope between the Jachin and Boaz columns, to the Masonic initiation, the transmutation of metals, to medieval alchemy. ',\n",
       " 'Other images seem to simply evoke proverbs; Temperance throws water into its wine; the Star (but why the star?) carries water to the river, dogs bark at the moon. In short, these are not religions or scientific matters, that are reached here. It is, as if, the unknown author of the tarot had come to some knowledge, that would recognize their profound unity, which encompasses them all in the same vision. Or, if you prefer, that he has taken advantage of, by the grace of God, for his collection of images, so the mess of beliefs and myths where all merged into one. One must analyse them more closely. ',\n",
       " 'However, each card, in its own way, offers, in depth, the same disorder. Is that old man disguised in a red cape, a blue coat, and a yellow tiara really the Pope? (He should be white, as we all know). And why does Death cut heads and hands already buried (or would it be a second death?) and the Hanged man, where does his triumphant air come from, that party costume and looking at the card - is he hanging by one foot? - his dancing aspect perhaps? Why is the Devil a hermaphrodite? What about the Juggler? Being placed on a deserted mountain, is not the custom of Jugglers. Why is this air of inspiration, a symbol of infinity? Is this tarot card itself a juggler or a fortune teller? Is he God? The Fool is the only one in the Arcana that has no number, as if madness threatens the player - or the initiate – at any moment perhaps? The Name. Why do certain names deceive us? The eighteenth Arcanum, has as its subject the moon (as labelled) - or perhaps that mysterious crayfish that appears only vaguely, blue in blue water, but our eyes do not seem to detach from it. Likewise, in the seventeenth Arcanum, the star gives way to the young girl with two jugs; the Sun in Arcanum nineteen, to twins. Why do the two boys falling from their tower, seemingly without reason, show such pleasure when hitting the ground? The fortune on its wheel of transformation as represented in the last Arcanum, as you look more closely, into that androgyny rising to the heavens (is that the soul finally liberated?) does it lead to the Juggler and his magic staff? It seems that the cycle never ends.',\n",

       " 'INTRODUCTION ',\n",
       " 'The tarot is a set of images, that symbolically expresses the work, man needs to undergo in his own evolution. In other words, to his purpose, what is inscribed in his destiny. An evolution that will require struggles, efforts, joys and sufferings according to whether or not, he agrees with the universal laws. ',\n",
       " 'Having chosen the Tarot which best expresses this journey; the Tarot de Marseille[3], one will find the symbolic interpretation of it in this book. ',\n",
       " 'The 78 cards of this Tarot are presented with two different classifications; the first 21 cards + 1, traditionally called the Major Arcana, and then the 56 Minor Arcana, which are broken down into four series of 10 cards, followed by four courts. ',\n",
       " 'In order to make a symbolic interpretation of these cards, each Major Arcanum makes use of, except for the Fool, a number at the top, an image whether human, animal or an object in the centre and a name at the bottom, except for Arcanum XIII. ',\n",
       " 'The 10 Minor Arcana of Swords, of Cups and of Clubs, with the exception of the Aces, display a number and no name. The 10 Arcana of Coins, neither number, nor name; while the 16 Courts that follow do not have numbers only generic names. ',\n",
       " 'The number, taken symbolically, reveals the philosophical principles, that allow us to understand the language of the makeup of the Cosmos, with its laws and principles. The meanings each number can represent are infinite. The comparisons of the principles represented by the number with the figure itself, makes it possible to specify the point of view, from which it has been contemplated, equally so, the qualities of its colours, the relative arrangement of the objects and the particular meaning, which presides over the image on the card, provides a basis for interpretation. ',\n",
       " 'The colours of the figures´ clothing that may seem inconsistent, the apparent naivety of Tarot figure design, are not, as some commentators seem to suppose, errors or work of negligence, but rather conceal a very precise symbolic value, that one should not cease to explore. ',\n",
       " 'Finally, the name, due to its specific nature, symbolizes the concrete and tangible aspect, that the card can represent, when its principle meaning is given by the number. The study of this name will allow, therefore, to specify the tangible meaning of each card. ',\n",
       " 'Thus, each Major Arcanum will be studied in the following order: ',\n",
       " '* In an analogic sense, of the particular number, specifically as it relates to the card or principle; ',\n",
       " '* The derived abstract[4] meaning, which gives the general quality of the card; ',\n",
       " '* An interpretation of the symbolism of the main object on the card;',\n",
       " '* The description of the details, through the interpretation of its attributes, colours and the particulars on the card;',\n",
       " '* The Orientation of the figure;',\n",
       " '* The meaning of the name used on the card, its application in the concrete, this meaning however being subordinated to its abstract meaning. ',\n",
       " 'Given that the number of positive significations are too great in number to be determined; it will be necessary to limit oneself, to give a few meanings to each of the elements of the human ternary, chiefly: The “Mental” or intelligence, the “Animistic”[5], that is, the emotional, passions, and finally the “Physical”, the utilitarian aspects of life. Then, as everything has its opposite, the meaning will be suggested, when the card is inverted. This will then conclude by assigning a definition of the elementary meaning of the card. ',\n",
       " 'As the circumstances in where the Major Arcana have been studied are modified by the introduction of the Minor Arcana, a new study, the symbolism of numbers, on one hand, and of the suits, on the other, must be examined before any further interpretation. ',\n",
       " 'The Tarot is a universal vibrating instrument and becomes a source of energy through the fluidic projections of our thoughts. By giving us the symbolic keys of the universal laws, that preside over the destiny of man, the Tarot allows us to make associations from these currents and, consequently, foresee certain events by analogy or affinity. In order to allow a party to the cards to see along these lines, of the method of use, it is finally presented here, to make possible the deductions from Tarot combinations, the implications relating to all momentary concerns, as established by the card spread, as well as the elementary rules that allow one to make useful deductions.[6] ',\n",

       " 'ORIENTATION OF FIGURES AND SYMBOLISM OF BODY PARTS[7] ',\n",
       " 'The orientation of the figures indicates the nature of the action[8]. Depending on whether the figure is seen from the left profile, from the front or from the right profile, there is meditation, reflective action, direct action or evolution, meaning a restrain of action. If the figure is standing, there is an indication of latent work and it is in an active mode; activity, command, energy. If it is sitting, its action is exercised passively; inertia, resistance or internal elaboration. In this interpretation, the head plays the leading role, because it symbolizes the inclination or the will. If, for example, the body is facing forward and standing, the head turned to the left, as in the Juggler, there is a reflection taking place, before proceeding to the action, which has already been prepared to be direct. ',\n",
       " 'The HEAD in the Tarot expresses the will, of command. ',\n",
       " 'The COVERED HEAD equates to figures who do not express their will in the physical. The headdress represents the issue, the will is manifested along the lines symbolized by it. For example, a crown represents a larger radiance, taking its origin from more subtle planes, owing to the rosettes on it, they constitute centres of attraction. The will here is more impersonal, than in the other headdresses, where instead, things generated by individual will are represented. ',\n",
       " 'The HAIR expresses fluid emissions. If it is colourless, there is no great willpower, but if it is coloured, there is a greater manifestation of mental activity. If in colour gold, it represents a more formal, more concrete, a more accomplished mental realization. If in colour blue, the force is enclosed in the spiritual and tends to decrease. ',\n",
       " 'HAIR IN DISORDER is an indication of a will with great power behind it. ',\n",
       " 'HAIR CAREFULLY STYLED has no particular meaning; the demonstration of will is more contained; for example, by “The Justice”, who is mentally fairly accomplished. A BEARD indicates the will, a wilful and a more focused concentration. ',\n",
       " 'The NECK is a link between the mental (head) and the animistic (chest); UNCOVERED, indicates a simple communication between both planes; COVERED, reinforces, according to its colour, the difference between animistic intensity and mental intensity. ',\n",
       " 'The NECK should be supported at its base in order to avoid bad composure and bad dispositions. Completely uncovered, represents freedom and independence. ',\n",
       " 'The TORSO represents the animistic aspect, buttons and ornaments are animistic enrichments, peculiarities: If the dress is of two colours, the animistic has a double meaning. The entire torso represents animism, with its spiritual aspect on the chest, and its material aspect on the belly, such as maternal love vs. instincts. ',\n",
       " 'The BELT is the animistic aspect that deals with reasons of will; man does not just give up, but finds reasons for his impulses and actions. ',\n",
       " 'The ARMS indicate intelligent, reasoned actions; they are interpreters of the mental and the animistic (the colour indicates whether the mental outweighs the animistic). ',\n",
       " 'The LEFT ARM the left arm is the transmission of the altruistic and the affective animistic messages, the psyche that directs it. ',\n",
       " 'The RIGHT ARM transmits the decisions, the will, the hopes, the leading to action. ',\n",
       " \"The LOWERED ARM means an action that has produced its fruits or an impediment to act; “The Juggler's” lowered arm underscores his indecision and his modesty. \",\n",
       " 'The RAISED ARM indicates the connection with the above, the capture of forces. ',\n",
       " 'ARMS ON THE BELT represents the circulation between the animistic and the physical, as if to detach or let go, or to decide on something. ',\n",
       " 'The LEGS indicate the realizations through action. If man is halted, the action is halted; crossed legs represents the waiting, the status quo. ',\n",

       " 'The number 1, an expression of universal positivity, symbolizes the primordial creative principle, within its multiple reali-zations. The manifestation of this power, situated at the origin of all things, makes it engender, through its repetition, all the universal active and passive forces, of which the other numbers are a representation of. This is the one, that particularizes and defines objects and phenomena in the world of senses. ',\n",
       " 'GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING ',\n",
       " 'In the study which follows, the first card of the Tarot a reminder of the positivity of the primary, should make us imagine an active and creative power. This is why it is depicted as someone standing surrounded by certain tools allowing him to perform his activities. The symbolism of this first card expresses, therefore MAN AS AN ACTIVE AND CREATIVE POWER. ',\n",
       " 'The qualities of this power are indicated by the appearance of this card, as much as in the details of the figure, his clothing and in the depicted objects. ',\n",
       " 'At the dawn of his creation, man was projected onto Earth, surrounded by a world, naturally hostile, was reduced to an activity of conservation and defense. This spawned in him responses that he strove to perfect. This ability he acquired over time, and is still in the process of developing. This has led us to compare, in the Tarot, man to that of the Juggler, forced, by his situation, continually to direct his attention on the phenomena of the world of the senses. These inclinations, manifested, give the first card its name; The Juggler. ',\n",
       " 'It may be observed, first of all, that the Juggler is standing firm, with his feet planted on the ground, he has the magnetic influence of someone remaining modest. The wand, a symbol, like the scepter, of intellectual authority, he holds in his left hand, pointing to the sky, allowing him to maintain contact with the currents above, the organizers of terrestrial influences, while his right hand manipulates, with skill and discernment, the objects on the table. ',\n",

       " 'FEATURES BY ANALOGY ',\n",
       " 'In general, one will take notice of the hat, in particular, which exterior is light green, indicating adaptation and mental[9] strength. The yellow or gold cap; wisdom. The red brim; material passions. The shape of it as a ∞, a symbol of infinity, of universal life, reminds us, that man is subject to the chains of universal harmonies of which he is also part. ',\n",
       " 'The hair of the Juggler, white in its length and golden at its curly ends, designates wisdom as the fruit of age and experience. ',\n",
       " 'His tunic above the belt is, on the left side blue and on the right red, and these colours are reversed below: The blue represents the psyche and the receptive aspects of his personality, and the red, the passionate and active aspects of his personality, each in balance with the other. ',\n",
       " 'His belt is yellow, a mental link uniting wisdom and spirituality, and his collar white, for this spirituality must be subjected to intelligence, represented by the head. ',\n",
       " 'His left arm is red on top, yellow in the middle and blue below. He is holding between his fingers a yellow wand; the arm is a symbol of gesture and power, and the left arm is directed by the psyche, since the material world, inert in of itself, only moves under the influence from gestures of the psyche.',\n",
       " 'His right arm is opposite to his left in colour, and he is holding between his fingers a yellow ball which synthesizes the principles of cosmic matter. This arm is positioned lower to indicate, that man must subordinate his actions, as suggested by his right side, to the laws of the cosmos in the moment, he is in contact with them. ',\n",
       " 'His legs, the left one blue with a red shoe and the right one red with a blue shoe, indicate that the right side must master the elements by balancing his psyche with his actions. ',\n",
       " 'He holds a sphere in his right hand and, as depicted, appears to be a disk as much as it appears to be a ball. The Juggler is engendering this illusion and can present it, as he pleases, as flat or spherical. The ball represents a state of continuity; when presenting it as a disk, the Juggler is limiting its state, in this state it represents human Intelligence. As a ball, however, it is an expression of divine intelligence. The Juggler can, using his powers, present it, one way or the other. In other words, he can confine intelligence to the physical plane and keep it there, but he cannot do so on the plane of the psyche. It is for this reason that he shows the sphere in both aspects. ',\n",
       " 'The table, in the colour of flesh, symbolizes the living, the material support, the Juggler can use in his schemes. ',\n",
       " 'The bag with objects is yellow: scattered as they are, they have their own destiny, but will reunite in the bag, give up their individuality and re-establish unity by forming a complete composite, overseen by the mental. ',\n",
       " 'The yellow cup represents mental power. It can contain the three yellow pieces, Trinity expressed as a mental element, and the four red pieces, divided into two sets of two, symbolize the double polarity. These constitute the four elements, the principle of the material world. ',\n",
       " 'The isolated use of the red pieces reflects greed, the individual´s search for wealth, whereas the isolated use of the yellow pieces denotes the struggles of the higher mind. The simultaneous use of the three yellow pieces with the four red pieces creates a septenary, which exerts the radiance and power of divine intelligence allied with temporal intelligence. ',\n",
       " 'The dice, a representation of chance, are yellow to show that divine intelligence always intervenes and that nothing happens by chance. The points marked on them point out what man calls chance is actually the combination of numbers, obeying laws so profound as to be invisible. ',\n",
       " 'The knife represents the object which can cut the thread of life, but the blue colour of the grip indicates that it can only be used in an animistic way. For man is able to be a master or a slave of his destiny, depending on the state of his soul. Its sheath, also blue, signifies his freedom in the application of the knife. If man puts the knife back in its sheath, he renounces the power to eliminate flawed feelings and becomes a slave to himself. ',\n",
       " 'The red cup is temporary power, of combinations; the dice are separated as with the knife, separated from their sheath. ',\n",

       " 'These diverse elements are all invested in him, there is potential for evolution of matter through the spirit, but instead, they oblige him to struggle adverse hidden forces. If he trusts his wisdom, these forces will allow him to maintain his balance and in this way he can be the master of them, rather than be their toy. ',\n",

       " 'PRINCIPLE The number 2 is equal to 1 + 1. Unity being at the origin of the numbers, it can generate by successive additions, an increase in a series, therefore positive. Or facilitate a descending series, consequently negative. If both units are represented in the same direction, there is a collision and an arrest in the movement. If they are in opposing directions, there is polarity, the origin of movement and the foundation of something fruitful. The number 2, which synthesizes these two points of view, one of stop and the other of movement, symbolizes the fertility of nature, which is generally defined as stops and of plasticity. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING The figure on Arcanum II presents a massive figure in the shape of a veiled woman, wearing a tiara and thus corresponding to the universal fertile nature, sanctified; meaning, carrying in her a latent state, the cosmic power of reproduction. She can be considered as THE DIVINE WIFE THROUGH HER ABILITY TO ENGENDER ETERNALLY AND FOR CREATION, THE ILLUSORY REALITIES OF THE MAYA. Due to her passivity in the spiritual, she represents the mysteries, things hidden, she contains riches, which she keeps in her subconscious, as they are not externalized. The open book on her knees indicates, that it must be deciphered, perceived, rather than read, because her figure shows, her finger on a book, without looking, like a blind man feeling his way; it is the representation of the infinite possibilities of nature. This card represents, therefore, things hidden, intuition, the understanding of the powers of nature. It is passive before the Juggler, but he has no power without her, because the active principle would be lost in infinity, if the passive principle that retains it, is not found. She wraps him in her protective mantle and gives shape to what he wants to create. FEATURES BY ANALOGY The significance of the colors on the costume can be related back to Arcanum I. The red robe[11] indicates the dominance of passions; the blue mantle, spirituality realized, subverting these passions, as well as covering and protecting her with religion and mysticism. The collar of the mantle its closure, and the yellow cords, are the ties that retain wisdom; bringing in spirituality and subjugating the passions for intelligence. La Popess wears a gold tiara to show, that she is illuminated by solar radiance; meaning, by superior wisdom, its three levels, loaded with precious stones, evoke the three worlds; physical, animistic and mental. The physical circle, the lowest of the three, has rubies and topaz stones alternating. The rubies in the shape of four-leaf clovers, represent material activities. The topaz, a symbol of knowledge of universal laws, alternate with the rubies, but smaller in size, indicating Earth is only dimly illuminated by wisdom. The animistic circle, which is placed in the middle, bears emeralds, which indicates knowledge in the domain of the psyche, and the two pearls that are in support, the sublimation of feelings, the suffering of the psyche, which leads to spiritual bliss. The third circle, which has only a round crystal stone, cut like a diamond, symbolizes the pure mental and indicates through its round shape its role as the infinite; meaning, it has neither beginning nor end. Under the tiara is a white headdress falling over her shoulders. The Popess is and should be a symbol of purity. The flesh-colored veil behind the tiara shows that the upper part of this woman, a symbol of passivity, in a veil of matter may be hidden. It hovers around the tiara to make clear all the instability and mobility in the feminine principle, in face of rigidity in the wisdom indicated by the tiara, its qualities being immutable and eternal. The opposition between the white headdress and the shaded veil explains how the feminine principle attracts sexual instinct from its need for motherhood, in as much so, its unconscious intentions remain pure. The mantle can also be interpreted as an aspect of wisdom, but since it is unstable and capable of being worn and unworn, it cannot represent anything more than terrestrial wisdom. The open book is flesh-colored to indicate, that it represents the evolution of life on the physical plane, not only in all its forms, but also as a symbol of inheritance and of the continuance of the species. The tiara and the book have very different interpretations: The open book shows the woman, taken to be a representative of the feminine principle, carrying within herself the knowledge of nature, but also that she can be its victim, in the moment, she allows herself to be covered by the veil of flesh, a symbol of the passions that imprison her and make her its slave. However she can equally represent the purity of nature, if she is able to preserve the purity of the white headdress. In that moment, she will be able to read the book, that reveals the knowledge of the past, of the laws of nature, on how to manage these laws, all the while, the tiara brings her the knowledge from the Above, indicated by the shine of precious stones. Her feet are invisible because she must remain immobile, owing to her passivity. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The position of the Popess, sitting, three-quarter to the left, indicates work, activity in concentration, calm and meditation. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The name of the card THE POPESS means; the highest principle of nature, of matter sanctified. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. This card is very fruitful in the contribution of ideas. It solves problems, but does not suggest them. ANIMISTIC. She is cold but friendly, welcoming, not affectionate. PHYSICAL. Situation assured, power over events, revelation of things hidden, certainty in triumph over evil. Good health, weightiness. INVERTED. Things slow down, she becomes more passive, nothing can be extracted from her anymore, she is a burden. Insights bring upset, intuitive revelations become false. Delay, stopping, difficulty in realizations. In sum, in its elementary sense, THE POPESS represents nature, with its mysterious riches, which man must unveil and interpret.',\n",

       " 'THE EMPRESS (L’Impératrice) ',\n",
       " 'PRINCIPLE The number 3 is equal to 2 + 1; meaning, the unity or the potential for action before a fertile undertaking, which consequently engenders fertility. Indeed, the card represents a seated woman, holding in her right hand the eagle, a symbol of creative imagination, and in her left hand a scepter, a symbol of creative power, crowned by a terrestrial globe, a representation of her power over matter. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card defines a harmonious set of + and -, by an activity in the passivity of matter, over which it has dominion and, conse-quently, a whole organized for the purposes of production and evolution, that is, THE EVOLUTIONARY POWER OF FERTILE NATURE. FEATURES BY ANALOGY  The golden globe of the scepter which the Empress holds in her left hand, resting on her arm, represents the universe, and the cross that crowns it indicates, that spirituality must dominate matter by penetrating it. The shield that she holds firmly on the right depicts a yellow eagle on a flesh colored background. It indicates the intelligence acquired by itself by experiencing matter. Moreover, its position against her bust indicates, that she is inclined to master its great intuitions; however as the eagle, being no more than an image on a shield, more an expression of the imaginary than of reality. The shield, essentially mobile, indicates that it can be used for protection or be abandoned at will. The Empress is seated, because she represents the power of the physical world, which is a state of immobility, and her invisible feet, as in the previous card, a confirmation of this. Her massive throne shows, by its color of flesh, that it is not there just for momentary support, but for definitive stability. It represents the roots of physical life. Her crown comprising three gold spheres on a cap in red, requires of her mental powers. She is open to allow the mental by intuition to penetrate the material world, indicated by the red of the cap. Her gold necklace is comprised of triangles, each one symbolizing; intelligence, matter and spirituality; through intelligence and by matter, they manifest spiritually in all domains, the whole must unite into one. The necklace represents the close coordination of these three states, which to reach perfection must not and cannot be separated. The gold belt is the demarcation line in the parts of matter, between that of the inferior, non-intelligent and that of the superior, dominated by intelligence. The gold medallion with a triangle, connected to her necklace indicates, that when matter is dominated by intelligence, spirituality is emitted, forming a whole. We do find, as in the preceding card, with the red of robe[12] the dominance of passions, but only up to her knees, the rest being in blue i.e. spirituality. The tufts of yellow grass is an indication of passive fertility. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The position of the Empress, sitting, from the front, indicates a clean cut and continuous activity in passivity. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The name of the card THE EMPRESS means the passive powers of the material world. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL.

       " 'PRINCIPLE The number 4 = 2 + 2 = 2 x 2 = 22, this is, the fundamental operations of Arithmetics. It is the only number which possesses this property, which makes it synthetic and gives it an integral multiplicity in combinations. Therefore 2 is found twice in the 4 with three different charac-teristics; in essence, 2 presents matter as halting and as being plastic, one aspect of the 2s accentuates this notion of stopping, consequently, that of matter itself, just as the other aspect of the number 2 represents the active side of matter, in all its aspects and with all its combinations. One can, in other words, regard this double 2 as forming a cross shaped polarity, one passive, the other active, which in combination guarantees a balance. 4 signifies therefore a balanced power in matter. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING Card IV shows a man, therefore an active principle, but remaining passive since he is in a sitting position, and as he is clearly in profile, facing left, he is giving himself over to reflection, to meditation, and to discernment. It represents THE ACTIVE POWER OF MATTER and, consequently, its changes and transformations, because this activity never leaves something immobile. This is the result of a mental influence subordinated to the principles of the cosmos. It operates through the impressions it makes on consciousness, more than through direct action; it generates life on the spiritual and biological planes. The Juggler and the Popess represent the two poles of the spiritual world, the Empress and Emperor the two poles of the material world. The Empress symbolizes the passive domain of matter, the Emperor the active domain. The Empress emphasizes evolution, the Emperor manifests its structure. This card therefore denotes a state which has been achieved, a realization. FEATURES BY ANALOGY The meaning of the sceptre is the same as in the preceding card on the Empress; the sphere of gold crowned by a cross shows the power of matter, when it is penetrated by spiritual influence. This is a sign of scientific knowledge. Without this quality, the sceptre would be without any power, because all science which is not animated by spirituality is sterile. The Emperor holds the sceptre in his right hand because it is the positive pole; the Empress holds hers in her left to it is the negative pole; the set of the two cards together create a balance between these poles. The Emperor holds his sceptre before him to affirm his actions, while the Empress lets hers rest against her shoulder to emphasize her passivity. The Emperor’s sceptre also indicates that his thinking is by justice and harmony, without any equivocation. The positive pole represented by the Emperor can only animate matter when it is connected to the negative pole, as represented by the Empress. This is why the shield, a symbol of powerful intelligent outbursts acquired by man, rests on the ground at his feet, at his disposal, he makes no use of it, while the Empress holds hers against her abdomen, available, to ensure the birth of material creations. The eagle depicted on the two shields is close to identical, the only difference being, the Empress’s eagle has its head turned to the right and the Emperor’s eagle is turned to the left, each one, on either side of the sceptre to indicate, that the idea that presides over the intellectual impulses is intuitive and inspired by the Empress, but are reasoned and desired by the Emperor. This is emphasized by the position of the wings on the eagle, raised upwards on the Empress’ shield, while natural and symmetrical on the Emperor’s shield, and wherefore, in the latter, the eagle brings an applied intelligence to practical things, its separated legs leave a gap, indicating it unites two separate entities; it establishes an equilibrium. While the Empress is seated firmly on a throne, the Emperor is simply leaning back on a small flesh-coloured chair, in an unstable position to indicate that although he remains immobile, he is poised to stand up and is not as immovable as the Empress. He has only one foot on the ground: a symbol of his inclination to move, therefore to evolve, with the indication that the positive pole can only have intermittent contact with the material. He is wearing white shoes, a symbol of nothingness, thus underlining the fact that he cannot walk; the Emperor who seems to always be on the move, can neither move forward nor backward; it shows “immobility in action,” an apparent contradiction which means that, although positive, therefore active, he is in matter that is fundamentally negative and holds him in his place, as indicated in the preceding paragraph. His white collar, next to his head, is an indication that he is able to achieve an understanding by himself and that this supports his sterility if he remains insulated. This white collar also underlines the separation between the head and the body, specifying that in matter, the fall comes by means of the head, the animator´s principle. His crown, similar to that of the Empress, has the same meaning. His necklace consists of a golden cord; this braided tie is an adhesive and not that of bondage, like the one on the Empress. It shows that the positive pole, not being a spiritual state, can have nothing but a fragile bond with the spiritual. The joining ring on this necklace represents the principle of the circle, to which the Emperor must subordinate himself in order to bring about achievements. His clothes, a tunic and breeches, are blue[13] finishing in white, on the collar and feet, denoting therefore a latent spiritual state, as the blue of his legs shows, that he is always able to go towards it and to achieve it. His red mantle indicates that he is enveloped in matter of which he is the animator. His left hand is grabbing his yellow belt to show that he is able, through his psyche, to seize, to grasp the bond that attaches intelligence to the material plane, and to use it in order to exercise his domination over the material world. The tuft of yellow grass has the same significance as in the preceding card, passive fertility, the yellow ground; the lever of wisdom. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The position of the Emperor, leaning against a throne, indicates passivity, the waiting prior to action, which with his raised foot indicates is imminent. It is a forthcoming realization, and every realization implies a result, a change. The Emperor makes decisions before acting. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The name of the card, THE EMPEROR indicates someone who judges action and who has the power to map out practical applications and to give useful council. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. Balanced intelligence not exceeding what is useful for a plan of action. ANIMISTIC. Agreement, peace, understanding, an agreement in opinions. PHYSICAL. Transient goods, transient powers. Signature on a contract, the fusing of two or more groups, a given situation. A healthy balance but a tendency to be bloated. INVERTED. Results contrary to those described above, everything fumbles, a disruption of balance. A fall, the loss of property, of health, or of control. In sum, in its elementary sense, THE EMPEROR represents the material energies necessary for man to bestow onto his fleeting creations, in a moment of solidity.',\n",

       " 'THE POPE (Le Pape) ',\n",
       " 'PRINCIPLE The number 5 = 4 + 1 indicating thus the unit of superior action or consciousness standing before matter, represented by 4; it has the power to act and to divert matter. The number 5 can also be defined as 2 + 1 + 2, the principle of unitary mediation between the two aspects of the material world; that which is inclined to stillness, and that which is inclined to action; between that which is inclined to the negative and that which rises above it, towards the positive. Card V, depicting the Pope before two figures, represents more specifically the second intention given to the number 5, that of the mediator. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This Arcanum represents: THE PRINCIPLES OF SPIRITUAL POWER TRANSMITTANCE. FEATURES BY ANALOGY This card is a continuation of the Emperor since he dominates it, because the Pope represents the spiritual immensity which dominates the world, the spirituality in all things, and without it there can be no evolution. Without the Pope, the Emperor and the Empress would be negatives and remain sterile. The Pope wears a crown identical to that of the Popess. His red robe, longer than that of the Emperor, shows that his power of action is more powerful and that he can cloak himself with matter at will, realizing thus, an act of concrete manifestation, permitting him to express himself in the physical. Its edges are gold and indicate, that he can restrict the tangible, meaning, intelligence surrounds it. It is equally the symbol of the presence of the divine spark in the concrete. Under his red robe, he wears a blue tunic, indicating a potential for activities of the psyche. The gold medallion pinned to his collar, in its centre a white crystal[14], shows his purity of intention. His arms, dressed in white, imply abstinence from action and show that this card represents a mental symbol, that cannot act on the physical plane but through the mind. He holds a cross of gold, with three crossbeams, representing the three worlds; the physical, the spiritual, and the mental, and equally symbolizing the temporal domain and the spirit of sacrifice. His left hand, wearing a yellow glove, marked by the seal of sacrifice, holding a cross, shows that he may not manage the cross without first appealing to his intelligence. The two blue pillars situated behind the Pope represent, through the pillar on the right, the rise of action, and through the pillar on the left, the use of feelings. When these two poles are balanced through spirituality, they are based in an unshakable, solid foundation. The two figures at his feet, symbolize the dualism of the forces which are in man, and which are able to turn towards good or evil, depending on whether they detach from matter or immerse into it. The figure to the right of the Pope has a yellow tonsure, signifying intelligence, and flesh-coloured hair, indicating the physical plane. With his right hand turned down, he represents the descent into physical manifestation from where he administers the powers of good through spirituality, which he then directs by white magic, or the kind of magic permitted when overseen by higher intelligence (the yellow robe of the figure), or by spirituality (the blue hat). The red hood shows that he is able to cover himself for protection on the plane of passions. The figure situated to the left of the Pope, whose hair and tonsure are flesh-coloured, represents the work on the plane of passions, towards his elevation into the spiritual plane, as indicated by his raised left hand. The yellow stole sandwiched in his red robe signifies that the lowest life must, in order to elevate itself, always have a particle of intelligence embedded in it. This is the divine spark which permits it to evolve. The absence of a hat, shows that the spiritual cannot evolve in the material world directly, it can only act through an intermediary; the mind. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE',\n",
       " 'The position of the Pope, facing the reader, sitting, underlines direct action through instruction. The two figures, seen from behind, facing in the opposite direction, have stopped in order to submit and give attention.

UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. The Pope, representing an active form of human intelligence offers purely logical solutions. ANIMISTIC. Powerful feelings, deep affection, petitions which do not give way to sentimentality; it indicates normal feelings in circumstances where they occur. PHYSICAL.  Balance, security in a situation and in health. A secret revealed. Religious or scientific vocation. INVERTED. The card of the Pope inverted is very unfortunate, as it indicates men left to their own devices and to their instincts, lost in confusion, because they have no spiritual support. A project delayed, a vocation coming late in life.

       " \"The number 6 can be written like this (1 +2) + (1 + 2) in order to conform to the arrangement of the figures on this card. The number 2 by nature represents fertile passivity and the feminine principle. The two women thus constitute 2 + 2, while the masculine figure and cupid constitute two separate units, one in the plane below and one in the plane above. (1 + 2) + (1 + 2) represents the double current, both inclusive and evolving, detaching from matter or leading to it. The grouping of elements on this card create a fusion between the spiritual and the material, because the two women converge onto the figure in the middle with an emanation of their material desires, with cupid representing the spark.  GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING The meaning of this card is THE FEELING OF PHYSICAL LOVE AND THE ENGENDERING OF SPIRITUAL LOVE, and it announces that love is the axis of evolution for man and for the creation of things. When love arises, the soul is exalted, and the spirit projects a spark toward the high, which immediately gives a response on a higher plane. This is symbolized by cupid, a representation of love drawing its bow on the top of the card. The shock produced by this spark will bear its fruits and leave a foot print represented by the arrow, meaning, love, by elevating man above himself, allowing him in the physical plane some manifestations drawn from his own genius; liken to the musician, who finds in him his inspiration. Love is never sterile. FEATURES BY ANALOGY Interpreting symbolically the details of this card the emphasis is on the light rays, which emanate from cupid alternating in red, yellow, and blue, since the radiance of love acts out on all planes. The figure is flesh coloured to show his action with vital fluids. Cupid´s shoulder sash is both a tie and a mask; the tie between our dispositions toward flirting with earthly love, as well as to mask it with earthly sensations, always of divine essence, unable to take root in matter. It is fitted obliquely, and not by necessity. This shows that he cannot take prisoners, whatever the extent. His blue wings show that the first idea of love is a burst towards mysticism, and his yellow hair, that the intelligence of love elevates man above matter. The bow and arrow indicate speed and rhythm, for the arrow is a dynamic principle; they are white, therefore negative, since the action love prefers is profoundly internal, more virtual than real. The woman situated to his right represents profane love, love born from material well-being. Her left hand, which she has placed on the man's shoulder, and with her right-hand gesturing towards his lower body, indicate that she is influenced by her sexual polarity, however transitory, as the head wreath, she wears is not rooted therefore her dominion is of that the short-lived. Her long blue sleeves, slouching and open, indicate an inclination towards spirituality; but the blue hair reveals the superficiality in her. The sentimental effects caused by the attraction of material satisfactions cannot last, because it is nothing more than a simple mirage on the plane of physicality. The woman situated to the left represents spiritual love and the love between the sexes in that most noble of states. Her hair, long and blonde, indicates the role of the sun and the inspirations that emanate from such love. Her left hand, she has placed on the man’s chest showing that this superior love has the heart at its source. Her right hand[15] gesturing down emphasizing the ground, indicates that she causes matter to evolve. Her blue robe affirms her spiritual role and her dress edged in red, shows that she is adapting her sexuality towards spirituality. Her white arms determine the exaltation, she exerts on all levels by the harmonious synthesis in the range of feelings, which she is engendering. The man personifies someone in a state of evolution in the whole of the cosmos, that is, all that is subject to love’s laws of attraction. We symbolize this with a man, one representing the most elevated state, leading to highest spirituality. His tunic edged in red, shows the instinctive side of love, the blue, yellow and red stripes[16] highlights the various vibrations of love that filter through the different planes. The yellow of his arms and his hand[17] show the active tendencies, induced by intelligence towards divine love. His right hand on his belt, signifies that it is by a voluntary action that he has clearly separated spiritual love from visceral love. His hair, yellow, shows that intelligence needs to dominate and direct him in the physical plane. It is yellow, like the wreath on the woman to his right, it differs from it, in the sense that it represents an intelligence which is an integral part of man, and not just something transitory. The yellow ground represents desires, stripped of feeling and reduced to the psyche, putting the evolutionary basis for this card in the realm of intelligence. The ground is wavy, thus indicating the oscillations of the instinct heading towards love. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE Cupid, turned a quarter to the right, prompts the evolutionary factors steering man, in whatever he does, towards his constant transformation, his unremitting evolution. The wreath wearing woman, whose profile is turned equally to the right, propels continuous action. The other whose head is turned to the left, while looking straight ahead, incites him to a life of the interior prior to a direct action. The man, facing ahead, with his head turned slightly to the left, is deciding on a choice after reflection. The ensemble represents therefore a complex one, with respect to action. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The intervention of sexual polarity in man in all activities, he is called forth to manifest, his action in the discernment that he is required to carry out, to direct his life, is what gives this card the name THE LOVER. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. Love of beautiful forms in the arts of plasticity. ANIMISTIC. Devotion and sacrifice. PHYSICAL. Desires, love, sacrifice for one’s country, similarly all strong feelings on the physical plane. A card of union, of marriage. It represents, for the querent of either gender, infidelity or, in certain cases, a choice to be made. INVERTED. Disorder, division (as opposed to unifying), rupture, divorce. In sum, in its elementary sense THE LOVER represents the sting of desire, which incites man to unite with the universal, whether harmoniously or in a state of imbalance, according to whether he sacrifices himself for it or in the want to derive profit from it.\",\n",

       " 'THE CHARIOT (Le Chariot) PRINCIPLE The number 7, as an odd number represents an activity, and by this number the 7 states of all things, such as the 7 notes on the musical scale, the 7 colours.  It is represented in this card by 3 + 3 + 1; constituting the first ternary, which is of a material order, consisting of the Chariot and the two horses, that is, by a mass with two dynamic poles. The second ternary, that of a spiritual order, is defined by the two shoulder masks and the man himself, who presents his two appearances as well as his realities. Finally, his means of action is the unity represented by his sceptre. This will be explained further in the description of the card’s attributes. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card represents THE SETTING IN MOTION IN THE SEVEN STATES, meaning, in all domains. FEATURES BY ANALOGY The Empress and the Emperor represent the two poles of power in the material world, to be understood in their own way, meaning, towards all action from their domains. The chariot is the physical vehicle of man, also an expression of material power, and more specifically, of action exercised by man on Earth, and so is symbolized by the figure depicted on this card. It follows Arcanum VI, since love, when it exists as a divine spark, gives to man the power necessary for producing his manifestations in the material world. The sceptre, crowned by a globe, a symbol of cosmic matter, manifests the power which man, once born, possess in the material plane. The golden crown has the same regal significance, but, while the sceptre in his hand expresses the power of the law, the power of the crown represents the mental, fleeting as this can be. This power is exercised on the plane of cosmic matter, represented by the four elements, which are also indicated in the triangles, that make up his crown, comprising of four small spheres. His blue, metallic cuirass states, that man in his ascendant and perilous movement forward through the material world, must be thoroughly dressed in spirituality in order to protect himself. It is white at the top, near the collar, and yellow below, because this spirituality must be directed by intelligence, which is of a divine nature and constitutes a part of this cuirass. The stages of this movement forward, as well as the interior states which accompany them, are indicated by the details engraved on the figure’s cuirass. In fact, we can count fifteen points, divided into three series on the chevrons of the cuirass. The first two are comprised of six points each, making a total of 12, symbolising evolution. They form a polarization in where the upper and lower psyche, that is, the spiritual and the passions, are in opposition to one another and in this way, bring about each other´s evolution. The third chevron consists of three points representing what serves as the basis for the psyche of the 12 points. These are; the appetites, responding to the more primal aspects of man; the feelings, responding to his central and intimate aspects; the wants, responding to his higher aspects and mental aspects. The chevrons are isolated from one another to indicate that the points of the lower psyche, indicated in the bottom chevron, will not surpass their plane, which is of a purely physical order. These points represent the spiritual possibilities of man incarnated, possibilities that are limited on the physical plane. They cannot be extended into the abstract. However, the lower chevron does outline, by its position in the blue, a plane that allows the physical body to penetrate into the arcana of the psyche. The upper chevron manifests a different plane on which the spirit can rise high enough to surpass the arcana of physical life, entering the mental plane, and thus allow the spirit to escape from the body. In sum, these two upper chevrons indicate the two spiritual planes possible in the physical state. The four points appearing on the yellow lower groin protection of the armour, represent the four states that are born from spirituality on the physical plane.[18]',\n",
       " 'The cuirass consists of three sections to show that, in accordance with his evolution, man is able to choose one part of the breastplate and leave the other, or put on all three parts and assume complete possession of the spiritual protections, they bestow on him. Under this cuirass, we find a red tunic, representing the material world which is necessary for man to overcome in order to evolve. His right sleeve, being red, signifies that he here extracts active power from matter and from his left yellow sleeve, his passive states of intelligence. The red shoulder straps emerging from the mask on his left, symbolize the material world which his yellow arm must break off, expand with his intelligence. The two masks covering his shoulders show the face of man incarnated, weighing on him as he is nothing but a transient creation. There are two of them: one created in the present and the other created from the past which he retrieves, but one is no more important than the other, as they are equal in size. They are red because they have been created by man’s passions, and surrounded by yellow, as his intelligence lends them vigour, and so assigning them a momentary life. In other words, each man loses a face which his intelligence is able to rediscover or recreate with great accuracy, but this is of little importance over time. This duality expressed by the two masks express man´s internal and external face, the first one, the left mask, his mental aspect, the second the right mask, his side of action. The horizontal layout, a sign of passivity, places them in the intimate regions of man; and the pieces of fabric indicate, in addition to what has been mentioned, the fluid emanations of his psyche, fluids which penetrate the material world and so give the masks a point of support. The figure’s yellow hair sizes up the superior role of his intelligence. The chariot symbolizes the currents, which lead man along and oblige him to act without cessation. It also signifies that man is bounded by his own passions, entirely relative to him, as he is pulled and taken along with them. The pillars, by their spacing, show that he is able to escape towards what is above, and that he remains in his vehicle only by virtue of his passivity, which keeps him in the material world. Red in front and blue in the back, represents the equilibrium between the spiritual and material world, that which moves humanity forward.[19] The flesh-coloured canopy – or the veil of physical life– him being beneath it, are the curtains off the heavens, but nonetheless easily removed, if one wishes. The flesh-coloured wheels of the chariot, symbolize the cycles of life. The 12 nails visible on the wheel represent the 12 stages of evolution, through which man must travel in his life, as well as the 12 forms of temptation, which can test him on his path of evolution. Spiritual activity, polarized in the material world, is represented by the red horse, the polarization of spirituality by the blue horse.[20] The ground, yellow, indicates that man only advances by leaning on his understanding of the divine, and the tufts of green grass, are the images of hope, that are born with the progress of his advancement. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The position of the figure, head on, indicates that his action needs to be directed, and by the heads of the two horses turned left, that intuition is necessary for progress. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The name THE CHARIOT has been given to this card to indicate something tangible, of advancement, embodying an idea of embarkation and of progression. More generally, the material currents which pull man and oblige him to be in constant motion. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. Achievements, but without gestation or inspiration. In other words, give shape. ANIMISTIC. Display of affection, protector, beneficial, helpful. PHYSICAL. Great activity, quick action. Good health, strength, hyperactivity. As it relates to money, expenditure, gain or transfer of funds. It signifies also unexpected news, conquest. It can be interpreted equally as propaganda by words and depending on where the card falls, good news or slander. INVERTED. A bad card, indicating disorder in everything through negative activities, consequences of which are difficult to make up for. Accidents to fear. Bad news. In short, in its elementary sense, THE CHARIOT represents the dangerous journey of man through the world of the material, to achieve spirituality, through the exercise of his powers and with the mastery of his passions.',\n",

       " 'THE JUSTICE (La Justice) PRINCIPLE The number 8 can be broken down into (2 + 2) + (2 + 2) or 2 x 4. The first grouping implies a polarization of the number 4, that is, the quaternary viewed as active vs. passive and in its opposition, as spirit vs. matter. In other words, as the 4 is essentially material, it can be said 2 x 4 is 8 hence the developing material balance between the passivity of matter and the activity of same. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card is THE REPRESENTATION OF COSMIC INTELLIGENCE PENETRATING THE PLANE OF REALIZATIONS WITH THE AIM TO COORDINATE. This is why this card comes after the Chariot, in order to inspire humanity with the concept of equilibrium and to regulate responsibilities and rights in its path of evolution. FEATURES BY ANALOGY The card shows a woman, whose feet are not visible, seated on a yellow throne, important and solid, because cosmic justice, proceeding from the divine, is immutable, dispassionate, and founded in intelligence. Her sword, held in her right hand and placed against the upper rail of the thrones back post, and with its pommel resting on her knee, indicates implacability, vigour, and rectitude. It is the sword posed to strike, resting on a base of justice, and with its yellow; representing sanctions applied with intelligence and without the spirit of vengeance. The scales denote her capacity to make judgements in the material world; they are yellow along with the arm that supports them. The weighing is executed with intelligence. Her head is completely covered by a yellow headdress. This spares her of the hotchpotch of thoughts on questions, she must pass judgement on, as well as detailing, that justice is completely boxed-in, meaning, it is isolated from all influence and encroachment, and that her intelligence is not her own, but form the intelligence of all those who come to the realization of what they are owed and what they owe. Her sovereignty is affirmed further by the golden crown completing her headdress, where the central circle in the shape of an eye, symbolizes her gaze, which man cannot escape, along with the fairness of her judgement. The collar and the cord of gold together which she wears on top of her chest, show the portion of humanity, she brings into her judgement, while remaining bound to the laws of equilibrium. Her red robe and her blue mantel represent the passionate activities on the plane of the psyche and on the physical plane which she wears in order to carry out her judgements. The tufts of yellow grass indicate passive fertility, and the yellow earth is the foundation for wisdom. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE She is positioned head on, this is the only card that is presented in this way; it implies direct action to its fullest extent, but through inner work, given her seated position. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The title THE JUSTICE has been given to it, to represent the judgement of activities, which man has deployed for good or bad, in the course of his journey through the material world, as indicated by the previous cards. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. Clarity of judgement, advice on fair assessments, knowing how to participate and appreciate eventualities. ANIMISTIC. Dryness, contributing only with what is owed, possibility for cutting off emotional bonds, divorce, separation. This card constitutes the principle of rigor. PHYSICAL. Trial, rehabilitation, justice rendered. Balance of health, but with surplus, owing to the immobility of the card.',\n",
       " 'INVERTED. Loss, condemnation, injustice, trial with conviction. Great disorder, people victimized by underhanded people.

       " 'THE HERMIT (L’Hermite) PRINCIPLE The number 9 = 3 x 3, that is, three secondary ternaries included in one general ternary. These ternaries correspond to the three cosmic planes, which can be interpreted to be; the physical, the spiritual, and the mental, or by the terms; life, love, and light. The secondary ternaries are reflections of each element in the first ternary; they are clothed by them, but yet still separated from them. Therefore, love embraces life and light, and light is love and life. Without life, love does not manifest, and without light, it cannot be illuminated. Likewise, the spiritual exhibits a physical and mental quality; without the physical, the spirit could not be made concrete, without the mental, it would remain incoherent and devoid of all restrictions. The grouping of this ternary, in the number 9, suggests a perfect coordination of all these elements. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card represents WISDOM REFRACTING IN MATTER, wisdom in where truth is found, deeply veiled and hidden from human eyes. It is love and light, entering into the matters of life. FEATURES BY ANALOGY This card follows The Justice searching for the truth, indispensable for rendering justice. The lantern, alternating between yellow and red, which the Hermit holds in his right hand, indicates that his search must be carried out as much in the domain of light as in that of the spiritual. The top of the lantern, entirely yellow, shows that this search is guided by intelligence. It is in opposition to his robe and mantel, since it does not need to be sharply illuminated. As light cannot be found without personal reflection, the robe clothing him is that symbol. It is blue, with yellow lining, because spirituality must be internally intelligent. The one who seeks it without intelligence does not find it. The yellow lining which can be found on a corner of the mantel, to the left of the Hermit, is there to indicate that this intelligence is not so concealed, that man cannot see it, for he needs it to evolve. The red robe under the blue mantel shows that man remains ever impregnated with matter and that it is in matter that he must find the truth. This interior garment represents, therefore, an inescapable material state, with which we are obliged to clothe ourselves, while the mantel is the garment, which we choose to clothe ourselves, according to our purpose and state of evolution. The red hood signifies, that truth appears to be intimately entangled with matter, always in a relationship with intelligence. The yellow ball on the tip, shows that intelligence always wins in the end, whatever the situation may be. In other words, this hood symbolizes momentary states of matter, which one is able to throw off quickly, if one wants to. The staff, flesh coloured, touching the ground indicates the connection, which man is able to establish with the physical plane through his vital fluids. It signifies likewise that his path is hard to climb and that man frequently needs help, which he will receive from the physical world. The Hermit’s hair and beard are flesh coloured, since he evolves through the receptive and active play of his fluids. The yellow lantern, grooved in parallel lines, shows that he must always orient himself to the same ends, that of divine initiation. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE He is standing in profile, with his head turned mostly forward. He is with his thoughts, oriented towards direct action in reflection. The nature of his walk, is calm and reflective, and his stance suggests work with purpose. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The name THE HERMIT is given to this card to represent man´s retreat into himself to examine the results of the actions, which Justice has sanctioned. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES',\n",
       " ' MENTAL. A source of illumination and resolve to some problem.  A clarity which will appear spontaneous. ANIMISTIC. A source of solution. Coordination, aligning with affinity. This signifies prudence as well, not from the perspective of fear but through improvement. PHYSICAL. A secret unveiled, a light which will be shed on hidden affairs. With respect to health: a source of knowledge about the state of one’s health with advice on its cure. INVERTED. Obscurity, faulty understanding of a situation, the difficulty of going against the current. In sum, in its elementary sense, THE HERMIT represents man in his search for truth, calmly and patiently, using logic and light, partly in secret, which he directs with prudence.',\n",

       " \"THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE (La Roue de Fortune)[21] PRINCIPLE The number 10, within its context, is formed by the unity following the zero, symbolizing a departure and an accomplishment, and consequently an evolution. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card represents THE PREPARATION OF MAN FOR A NEW CYCLE, ONE RESULTING FROM A PRECE-DING CYCLE. It is the law of destiny and comes after card VIIII because truth and knowledge are at the foundation of this evolution. FEATURES BY ANALOGY This card presents three phases, as indicated by the three animal figures on the card, in order to show that they apply to all beings of creation. The first phase, a monkey on the descent, represents a descending evolution, a phase of instinct, which is not guided by intelligence, but by cunning or by skill, the full adaptation to physical life. It corresponds to involution, that is, the descent of divine spark onto matter, this association is symbolized by the colour flesh. The animal lifts its head in dislike, as the descend is involuntary. Its red and blue costume indicates an instinctive adaptation with the cosmos, manifested both in the material as well as in the spiritual plane. It separates the superior parts of the animal from the inferior, in the sense, that the inferior parts, more attached to the soil, must pass away for it to evolve. The second phase, the dog[22] represents the first degree of ascendance, the first flash of intelligence, which is why it is yellow. Its head, turned up, shows the germ of the beginnings of human emotions. Its vest, blue, skirt red, signifies that its intelligence is beginning to perceive the rudiments of spirituality and the need to leave matter behind. Its claws indicate that desires are still exerted, the dog collar, that it is still a slave, and even in this moment of self-liberation, attentively perceived with its ears. Its green[23] colour represents scientific adaptation, which is beginning to manifest in this second phase of its evolution. The third phase, the third figure, in shape of a sphinx, indicates destiny, unknown to man in his path of evolution, his aspirations towards an unknown, which he must decipher. This is the mystery to be unveiled, the last stage, that he, however, is obligated to pass, but the sphinx, will not answer the question, asked of him, about this ultimate goal. Man continues to enter into and out of matter, to return anew and to leave again through his successive lives, until man finds, on his own, an answer to his question. The sphinx is the manifestation of the role of the divine in evolution. Its crown of gold represents its supreme royal authority, the certainty of its judgement. Its sword is inescapable justice. This, held in its left hand, indicates its passivity, and the white blade expresses its neutrality. Its red wings show that divinity, of which the sphinx is an expression of, is in all things, and it having interpreted the world of matter, must escape it, without delay. Its body is blue, because it is the representation of pure and essential spirituality. The platform on which it rests is yellow, characterizing divine intelligence. The two yellow posts, supporting the wheel are the two poles of intelligence, active and passive, between which evolution must take place. They in turn rest on beams on the ground, also yellow, and connected with two crossbeams, in order to emphasize the solidity and immutability of its foundation. The wheel represents the cosmos; its drive wheel is flesh-coloured, lines in black. This deals with the role of the cosmos on the physical plane. The centre hub is red, because the two poles, in order to spin, must act before anything else on the material plane, then by the blue spokes, on the spiritual plane, and, from there, through the white spokes, on the mental plane. This last is represented by the colour white, not yellow, because it is detached from the intelligence owing to physical life. This separation in the form of the blue joint-rings represents the barrier, often impassable, which separates the spiritual from the higher mind. When man breaks through this barrier, he ceases to go on having successive lives. The spokes of the wheel, being similar in essence, represent a link between the interior and external life. Their number indicates the six planes of evolution, that is, starting from the lowest vibration ending with the highest: The Physical, the Animistic, the Mental, the Causal, the Spiritual, and the Divine. There are six spokes and not seven, since a seventh plane would symbolize a final destination and would deviate from the card’s correct meaning, which is to point out the steps of evolution. The crank indicates that man is able to slow down or speed up his own evolution. It symbolizes his capacity for free will, and indicates that he is not a slave to his destiny. He decides by the colour white how neutral his power will be. The ground, flesh coloured, grooved, represents the pivots of the poles in their mode of subtle resistance, on the physical plane. The flesh coloured rods joining the two supporting beams at the foundation of the wheel, represent the currents of life on the physical plane, but are bound inseparably to the mental plane, representing thus both involution and evolution. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The different position of each, makes this a complicated card. The sphinx is still and facing forward, the dog is in profile and ascending, likewise the monkey is in profile but descending. In as much, it is the sphinx who commands, and allows the action, one of the animals is active in its ascend, the other is passive as it descends, however the wheel turns regardless, so luck alternates and substitutes between the two, in their path of evolution. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The name THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE has been given to it, because the movement of the wheel implies a cycle, that returns to its point of origin, but brings with it the experiences acquired during its path. Experiences which will result in favourable or dire circumstances. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. Logic, as the wheel evokes balance and regularity. Sound and balanced judgement. ANIMISTIC. Participation, vitality, and strengthening of feelings. PHYSICAL. Whatever the events that occur in the querent's life, they are not stable, they are moving towards an evolution, a change, necessarily happy in nature, because the card is not a reversed. Security while in doubt. From the point of view of health: Good circulation. For married couples: fulfilling activities. INVERTED. The transformation will be done with difficulty, but it will be done regardless. It is not nefarious, but causes delays, due to current circumstances. It indicates that there is change in foundations and new beginnings.  In sum, in its elementary sense, THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE represents man in the midst of present actions, which have their origin in cyclical work of the past and which prepare for those to come in future, on which the divine in the end will award, whatever their vicissitudes.\",\n",

This principle, made up by the knowledge, that has been acquired in this cycle, thus represents a force, which does not come from up high, but which appears as an accumulated energy.  GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card represents the powers which result from completing a cycle. It indicates, consequently, struggles and the will to win, a state which can only be realized if man masters this force, rather than it mastering him. This will of the spirit is symbolized by a woman, in order to show that force should be exercised without violence. FEATURES BY ANALOGY Her hat, blue, yellow, and white[24], represents the three states of consciousness; spirituality, intelligence, and superior mentality. The dress´ braided section indicates the link between the spiritual and the mental. The algebraic symbol in the shape of the infinity sign ∞, which has no beginning nor end, means that it embraces the entire universe, and that it ensures its strength through equilibrium. This is the will of beings on all planes. The black line around her neck represents the demarcation, between a higher intelligent physical plane and a lower physical plane, which is subordinate to intelligence.  The blue dress and the yellow corset, with tight lacing, show that the spiritual is a state in her, surrounded by intelligence, and the mantle reduced to a red drop fold and not wrapped around the body, is exerting its action into material activities, in which, she cannot secure a victory, of more than a fleeting and disappointing nature. The arm that symbolizes the act of force, is dressed up with pleated yellow sleeves, and flesh-coloured cuffs, thus indicating that its actions, guided by human intelligence, operate in the plane of physical life, as much as outside of it, meaning, in incarnated beings as well as in disincarnated beings. For this reason, her foot is bare, and appears under her dress, specifying that victories are found in advance, and that this forward march can be done on any plane. The yellow lion represents the intelligent force of nature, against which man must fight, under threat of being devoured by it. She separates the lion´s jaws, thus demonstrating that she must look inside, in order to take on the forces hidden within, to know and to subdue them. This lion is also a representation of divine´s intelligence and the immutable force, that exists in the cosmos and in man, inseparable, because it is in opposition to power, albeit half hidden and without an aggressive demeanour, as if it were a part of it. No force can have effective action, without a close union between man, the cosmos and the divine. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE Strength keeps her head facing forward, however turned slightly to the right. The position of the head, leaning to the left, indicates thought and reflection. It is oriented towards an action, but must take time before carrying it out. Her body, not being entirely turned to the right, ultimately means that she is leaving reflection to move towards an effective action. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The name of the card, THE STRENGTH, specifies that this in a sense is, personal force over matter. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. It gives great power to recognize truth from what is false, the useful from the useless, and unmistakable judgements.  ANIMISTIC. In control of passions, the power of conquest. Example: A woman to be married will draw strength from affection. Affectionate protection.',\n",

Therefore, the number 12 implies, a renunciation, so a new cycle can start, if there is one, and if not obstructed by the work of the preceding cycle, and if it can be reoriented towards a new path. This is why this card is not directly related to the Strength card, but rather to the entire preceding series of cards, because it completes the primary cycle of the Tarot, that of 12.

This card is related to the Hanged Man, as it pertains to having an account of the knowledge acquired by the preceding cycle, from which man must remove, what may be useless or harmful, which does not suit the nature of the new cycle. Also, because of the spirit of sacrifice, implied by the Hanged Man, leading to the light, whose doors open with the disappearance of the physical body. This card is about the activity that intervenes in a preserved state of things. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This Arcanum means; TRANSFORMATION, SYMBO-LIZING THE MOVEMENT, THE PASSAGE, FROM ONE PLANE OF LIFE TO ANOTHER PLANE OF LIFE. It is in the invisible plane, the opposition to God´s image in our world, representing, in effect, immobility in physical life and the march into the hereafter. FEATURES BY ANALOGY The colour of flesh on the skeleton indicates, the persistence of human individuality, thus underlining that this is not just about a physical death but that another form of life remains in man. The abandonment of all terrestrial attributes is symbolized by the stripping of flesh and clothing, conserving only the necessary framework for the new to envelope. The principle of life, which the colour of the skeletons symbolizes, show the transformation, that it imposes and without which, man would remain stagnant, thus carrying out a real death. The skeleton is reaping in a black space, which symbolizes the dark passions of men, as well as the new evolutionary path, still shrouded in darkness. His hands and feet are not cut off, but represent a principle of action and progression. They mean that death frees man from his physical life, leaving with him the gesture and the advance. Indeed, the advance, is indicated by the foot planted flat, showing that man advances from one incarnation to another; the gesture, indicated by the hand, a symbol of touch and sensitivity, also placed flat, is what makes it to the next incarnation. They are in black soil to indicate that, despite of death, man is linked to the earth and that death takes its point of support on it and in it, so that he can be reborn. The two hands that protrude from the black soil show that death incites man to detach himself from matter and to elevate his gestures to the above. The two white bones represent the emptiness of the material, the two polarities of male and female. The head of the long-haired child indicates, that strength and intelligence survive death, likewise that divine intelligence is always found in man in a childlike state.[25] The crowned head means, every time death occurs, man enters his kingdom. The head is an adult, the royalty of men, it is an immutable thing, it has neither childhood nor old age. Yellow and blue leaves symbolize fertility; death cannot cut them down. They flourish every time man crosses the path of death. This fertility comes both from the knowledge acquired on the physical plane, and from the forces of evolution belonging to the spiritual plane. The handle on the scythe is yellow, because death comes from a divine and intelligent will, and the scythe blade is red, because death always cuts in the world of matter. Moreover, the scythe is not, in this card, a representation of a cutting instrument, but rather the symbol of an activity, that arms the material in order to renew it and make it available again. The skeleton has only one foot to indicate, that death implies a disequilibrium and can only act on the physical plane and not on the spiritual. It is not an aspect of harmony, but of consequence. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The figure´s profile, entirely towards the right, indicates transition, renewal, successive actions, with the indication of advancement; transformations with every step. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING Contrary to the other cards, it has no name assigned, although its image traditionally represents that of death. Since death does not exist, it cannot be named, because it would give this card a pejorative meaning, that it does not have. Its authentic meaning is that of transmutation, but this word, in itself, cannot be chosen either, because transmutation is at the origin of life and this origin is beyond words. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. Renewal of ideas, completely or in part, because something is going to intervene and transform everything, like a catalytic phenomenon, where a new body completely modifies the actions of the bodies that are in its presence. ANIMISTIC. Estrangement, scattering of affection, the wear and tear of a feeling, of hope. PHYSICAL. Death, the ending of something, immobility. In the matter of business; complete transformation. INVERTED.  From the point of view of health; stagnation, death can be avoided, but the condition is incurable. In its surroundings, it indicates death, and of implications persisting beyond the death itself. In sum, in its elementary sense, Arcanum XIII represents the change of states of consciousness in man, which accompanies the completion of a cycle and is at the beginning of a naturally different type of cycle.',\n",

       " 'TEMPERANCE (La Tempérance) PRINCIPLE The number 14 is equal to 12 + 2, meaning, to an accompanying evolutionary period, enclosed in a polarity. This is why this card takes its power from a concentration, due to the experience of a completed cycle, that works in a closed circuit, generating a movement between two soft, passive reservoirs, which compress one another. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card symbolizes THE GREAT RESERVOIR OF POSSIBILITIES THROUGH THE ETERNAL PLAY OF THE ENERGIES OF MATTER, it represents the eternal resumption. It follows card XIII, because this card does not mark an end. FEATURES BY ANALOGY The figure is that of an angel, in order to give meaning to immateriality, to show that her action is not the fruit from the work of men. She has blue hair, a sign of spirituality. The red star on her forehead guides her and shows that she can only act in the physical plane. Her flesh-coloured wings underline this action in the vital plane. The red arms show the interpenetration into the physical plane, the dress with various colours make her particularly intellectual and spiritual, with which she covers herself to hide the divine. Her work is carried out only in the world of energies. The dress is half red, half blue, because this balance must be maintained both in spirituality and in the material world, which cannot be separated. The angel leans to show, that it is the blue pitcher of physical spirituality, she pours into the red pitcher of matter. Her gesture and her position are persistent; while she remains upright, she can lean towards either side. The two pitchers symbolize the perpetual renewal that establishes the balance between materiality and spirituality, eternally pouring one into the other, without ever filling, forever renewing matter. The colourless water, neutral, represents the fluid, that joins the two poles, and in fact, are neutralized, starting from the blue pitcher and returning to same, following the principle of flow and ebb of forces. The angel is posing on yellow ground with green plants, to show that she has a divine basis with her action in the material, a basis that produces a terrestrial, but not divine, flowering. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE Her body is facing the front, but her head is turned to the left, indicating that she takes her time to reflect, because necessary time is needed, in reconciling the extremes of Temperance, before an action can be effective. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The title TEMPERANCE has been given to her, because she acts as a conciliator in all things.   UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. It brings the spirit of conciliation. The absence of passion in a trial. It provides deep meaning to things, representing an eternal principle, a psychic personality, not imposing an idea of stability, but something rather plastic, that is, moving, adapting to circumstances. ANIMISTIC.  People brought together by kinship; under the influence of this card they are satisfied, but they do not evolve and they do not leave the relationship. PHYSICAL. In business, conciliation, the pros and cons are weighed, compromises are found, but it is unknown, whether the enterprise will be successful. Reflection, a decision that is not taken right away. From the point of view of health; incurable disease, because it engenders its own fermentation. INVERTED. Upset, disagreements, but misrepresentation and hesitation will be overturned.',\n",
       " 'In sum, in its elementary sense, TEMPERANCE represents the work of adapting to a new activity, the work of kneading, which man performs in order to readjust to the new, and in a more broader sense, material energies readjusting to spiritual energies.',\n",
       " \"THE DEVIL (Le Diable) PRINCIPLE Among the different combinations, that make up the number 15, the arrangement 10 + 5 = 15, and 11 + 4 = 15, are particularly suited for the context of card XV. It is man introducing his particular vibration into an organized grouping. This activity takes place in opposition to the universal rhythm; thus, he is represented by the Devil. 10 means a completed cycle. 5 = 4 + 1 indicates a repetition of the cycle, an activity which penetrates the material world, that arises to work against it and to give to it, through vibration, the rhythm of life, represented by 5. From a different point of view, 10 represents the equilibrium of a completed cycle and 5 marks the instability of a new risky beginning. 11 indicates force and 4 matter; therefore, 11 + 4 = 15, signifying the force of will, energetically stroking matter and able to be used for good as well as for evil. This combination confirms and accentuates the previous, the one obtained by means of 10 + 5, and this is why this card follows Temperance who has the ability to materialize. The eternal repetitions of Temperance is done on the moral plane, unlike the Devil, who takes it onto the human plane. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING The Devil represents; A PRINCIPLE OF SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY THAT TRIES TO PENETRATE MATTER AND CLOTHE ITSELF IN IT, IN ORDER TO MATERIALIZE. He symbolizes a great evolution, because although he is the symbol of evil, he is also that of triumph. It is men who have conferred the symbol of maleficence onto it, it is deep, of divine essence and as necessary to humanity, as good is, constituting a bridge between good and evil, divinity, as man understands it, and can be viewed, depending on its interpretation, as good or evil. FEATURES BY ANALOGY His headdress is a crown of flames, to show that his origin takes place on a higher plane, because the Devil actually expresses the work of man in the universe, with the support of the divine, he himself therefore does not cease to be an expression of the divine laws. His blue wings, directed upwards, show that his action tends to produce an evolution upward. His torch frames the world of illusion, its white flame indicates his neutrality, and men, according to what activity they attribute to him in his domain, will give it colour. The torso bare, showing breasts and male genitalia at the same time, represents the male and female fertility in the vital forces of nature. His right arm is raised to affirm that his action comes from above, but his flesh-coloured claws and his position on terrain of the same colour, that he is trapped in the material plane, and that he will never be able to act on a divine plane. His red belt denotes that he is entirely surrounded by matter, even in its lowest expressions. His blue legs show that he makes man evolve towards spirituality. His hermaphroditism, indicated by the simultaneous representation of the attributes of both sexes, show, depending on, whether it is situated from the universal point of view, or from a particular point of view, that he perpetually engenders the renewal of matter by himself, penetrating it, with his vital force, or drawing everything back to him, because, by capturing the two, male and female poles in himself, he works in a closed circuit and captures these vital forces for himself. His red pedestal indicates that he dominates the material world. Its dimensions are modest, to show that his kingdom is precarious and has been made unstable by his nefarious activities. The two beings tied to the pedestal are the emanations of the Devil and represent the exterior of his sexual polarity, showing that man is chained and that he will suffer the consequences in exchange for its rewards, without the ability for escape. The two beings symbolize, consequently for the whole world, the experience of being dominated in human and animal matter, of being slaves. They are masculine and feminine because they extend the two principles of polarity to the world.  They have red bands on their heads, to indicate that man can mentally trap himself in the material, the Devil himself, not a representative of any principles of elevation. The black flames, the ears and the tails of animals, indicate that the Devil is a necessary force in evolution. A force from which one must emancipate oneself and without this effort, man embedded in the material cannot progress. Gloomy emanations, indeed. In other words, the Devil symbolizes man chained by nature, which stirs up an animal in him. This chain has its origin in the laws of cause and effect; meaning, in the consequences produced by man's past actions. The effects are bad, when man lets himself be chained by matter, and evolutionary, when he makes an effort to get rid of them.\",\n",
       " 'The ground, wild, with black stripes on a yellow background, means that the emanations of matter turned into evil can hide the source of divine intelligence. The parallelism of the lines indicates that the two walk together. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The main figure is faced forward, suggesting a direct act of domination, by contrast the smaller figures are a quarter turned: the one on the left (the female) towards the right, and the one on the right (the masculine) towards the left, with their heads almost faced forward, hence in opposite directions, in so suggesting the force of passivity combined with that of activity – but with constraints and disharmony as designated by their attachments, their horns, and other animal features. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The name THE DEVIL has been given to this card because it represents man acting in the material world through his own power, without spiritual support, so that when he is not in search of spirituality, he is subject to the temptations of transgressing against cosmic morality and capitulating to his instincts. The card signifies, therefore, success in the material world through direct effort and through the council of reason, or the surrender to the inevitable. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. Great selfish activity without concern for justice, this card does not have a practical significance on the spiritual plane. ANIMISTIC. Plurality, diversity, inconsistency, because it is sought with all senses and brought back to oneself only, without concern for others. Debauchery. PHYSICAL. Great radiation on this plane, particularly in the material domain, in concrete achievements. Great ability to influence others. This is, however, a physically deficient card; this success is obtained through the bad arts. Consequently, fortune acquired in a reprehensible way, or by theft that has gone unpunished. In the affective domain, it is the conquest of man by reprehensible practices, without scruples, involving the destruction of other men, but having success regardless. For this reason, it is a card announcing punishment, because, when appearing in a spread, it announces that the triumph will only be momentary, followed by its lessons, if the question posed is not exempt from selfishness. As a disease, it indicates great nervous instability, symbolized by the claws that attract fluids, from control and possession, consequences from the past. INVERTED. Its actions have a very bad foundation, with even more evil results. Disorder, inversion, shady deals or deals without results. From the point of view of health, increase of sickness, complications. In sum, in its elementary sense THE DEVIL represents a form of human activity, the stirring up of matter, of which man will become a slave, after having achieved a temporary success, or will free himself, with the powers of knowledge, according to weather his goals are selfish or that of material evolution.',\n",

       " 'THE TOWER (La Maison-Dieu) PRINCIPLE The number 16 can be presented in the form of 10 + 6. 10 represents a completed cycle, but which is renewed indefinitely, therefore a universal cycle, and 6 symbolizes involution and evolution, rise and fall, ephemeral construction and of starting again. 10 + 6 = 16 manifests the power of man, who wants to undertake everything, but who, being limited, cannot reach permanence; the fatally unstable construction. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING The tower shows THE LIMIT OF HUMAN POWER AND ITS IMPOSSIBILITY IN PERMANENT CONSTRUCTIONS. The preceding card, the Devil meant, among other things, evil, but evil being a human interpretation, therefore does not really exist. There are only forces that struggle for progress. The Tower comes after the Devil, because it represents human progress, which consists in a perpetual rebuilding, of what will always be demolished, the very principle of progress. Therefore, the tower means that every construction, created by man is destined to be destroyed, be it a mental construction or a physical construction, because everything that takes its foundation in matter will disappear. FEATURES BY ANALOGY The tower symbolizes a defective, erroneous construction, in which man encloses himself with self-deception. It is flesh-coloured, because it is built in the midst of the vital energies of man on the physical plane. The windows are blue; the wise man, who builds his tower, must always keep an eye toward spirituality. The yellow rampart means, that man always wishes to crown and deliver his work with a stamp of intelligence, however a purely human intelligence and so without efficacy. Fire destroys the works of man; but the yellow colour of the flames, as with the ground, signify, that they will be purified in returning to the earth, on whose contact, natural vital energies is provided, giving them the ability to start over. In other words, fire is the force, that man can always draw from, the divine, to continue his work, which is never finished. It also represents the purifying flame, that man will pass through, when he leaves his transitory building, passing on to the divine plane. The flame, by its red colour, also indicates his action in matter and, by its yellow colour, his divine intelligence. The blue and red man, who falls touching the ground with his hands, shows that whatever the cause that has made him fall - matter or spirituality – he will take up the fluidic forces from the earth again, supporting his hands on the ground and restart his task. His pose in a semicircle, evokes the image of the outstretched hand by which, man performs his actions on the outside world, he symbolizes the active pole. Thus, it describes the man who has operated on the environment, who has played his constructive combinations and who has subsequently failed. The second figure, whose sense of fall is opposite to that of the first, and whose pose seems horizontal, symbolizes the second pole, the passive pole, and his fall is heavier, because man who, by inertia, is unable to control the forces of that, he has taken over, loses the support, that was given to them and he falls back on to matter. His fall is not the direct result of his actions, but a slow descent produced by distant causes. The balls are the seeds of this construction, falling on the earth to germinate again. The red and blue, mean that the reconstructions will be material or spiritual, the white balls represent the apparent futility of the effort. None are yellow, because divine intelligence does not preside over this card, which applies exclusively to the work of man. They represent, by their number, the multiple forms on which man can build on the physical plane. This is about the various contributions from men on different levels. The soil, yellow[26] with sprouts of green, indicates fertilized human labour bears fruit. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The position of the tower is frontal, indicating a direct, violent action. SPECIFIC AND CONCRETE SENSE',\n",
       " \"The name of this card, THE TOWER (LA MAISON-DIEU[27]) comes from the fact that God, being omnipresent, is also in the buildings man constructs. But as he does not intervene and man is in the dark, his constructions are imperfect and destined for destruction. These constructs born in the thoughts of man, and according to him, strongly built, are devoured by the same flame that fuels his desires, and thus cause their fall. The tower, made of dense materials, is too concrete to allow for, the subtlety of the spiritual currents, represented by the lightning bolt. It disintegrates. The tower also means that man, believing himself almighty, erects it to extend his dominion, but since his free will is very limited, he sees it collapse, when he believes it to be permanent, and then he must begin again. It also symbolizes man trapped in his ideas and founding theories, which vanish with experience. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. Indication of the danger of continuing in a certain path, with a fixed idea, and a warning in order to avoid the consequences, under pain of violent turmoil and annihilation. ANIMISTIC. Domination by man, without charity or love, exerted on others with despotism, and which sooner or later, will be rejected out of affection. PHYSICAL. An affair abruptly stopped. A theatrical coup, unexpected shock, warning to beware in business. The flame that removes the rampart from the tower can be interpreted as a release from prison. From the point of view of health; an indication that the limits of one's vital forces are being exceeded and that there is a risk of serious illness. If it follows an illness, a recovery after a distressing state. INVERTED.  Great cataclysm, complete confusion. In sum, in its elementary sense, THE TOWER represents the transitory and fruitful constructions of man, always destroyed and always renewed, painful because they ruin ambition, beneficial, because they increase ever the wealth of wisdom.\",\n",
       " 'THE STAR (L’Étoile) PRINCIPLE The number 17 = 10 + 7. 10 represents the universal cycle, and 7 the septenary, meaning, an extended radiation expressed by the universal spectrum and specified by the 7 sounds, the 7 colours etc. The number of stars on the card also evokes 7 = 3 + 3 + 1; that is, the two ternaries of the seal of Solomon, to which unity contributes a principle of activity. This whole is synthesized by the great central star, that symbolizes the emanation of divine power, that manages the involutionary and evolutionary force in matter. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card, supported by the psyche and the spiritual, represents; THE PRINCIPLES THAT PRESIDE OVER THE HARMONY OF THE WORLD. It imposes the beauty of divine construction to the imperfection of human construction, always in reconstruction. It places, up high, in the stars, the active principle of cosmic construction, sources of light, and below in matter, a woman, the source of psychic life. It follows the Tower to represent harmony, great universal forgiveness, the balmy that always comes after the fall, the appeasement of man before his rise. FEATURES BY ANALOGY The star represents the world on the physical plane. The great central star, grouped around it, seven secondary stars, synthesize the seven notes of the universal scale to make a singular harmony. This is evoked by its eight yellow rays, 8 constituting an octave, that is, a complete series. The 8 interspersed red rays, symbolize the same principle in matter, because in order for human need and understanding, it is necessary for the principles of divine intelligence be repeated in matter. The whole assemble forms the number 16, taken as 8 + 8, which, due to its repetition at the two poles, symbolizes the feature of perfect union between matter and the spiritual. Under the stars, and on the ground, there are two bushes, whose green colour is the image of renovation. On one of them is perched a bird, a symbol of individual life, being able to bond to the ground or expand into space, and all the while to sing, to the morning break or to the joy of change. The female figure is naked, thus showing, that the principle of harmony is not a clothed substance, and does not act more on one plane than on the other. The woman has only one knee on the ground, specifying that harmony does not rest on one point alone, but rather she must be ready, always, to take a step forward. It is the great feminine principle that directs the current of the worlds and works for their evolution. She makes this current flow from two pitchers, representing condensations, which allows for counting, sometimes with a spiritual influence, whose intensity is such that it cannot be effective, except if channelled. She manages this herself, to pour the dose that is befitting for man. The horizontal pitcher held by the left arm, indicates a passive contribution, given to man at rest, as if by chance - as the one, who receives his fortune while sleeping -, while the vertical pitcher represents the active contribution, that is, the one that man receives through his work. The woman is on the very edge of the embankment, because she is the source from which the water rises. This water is blue in colour, which means that this spiritual source is never dry, but it can only act by relying on the substrata of divine intelligence. This is determined by her knee, placed by her on the ground, whose yellow colour, chaotic and uneven appearance, leave her the option of sculpting it and shaping it in beauty. She has two red pitchers in her hands, thus showing that it is through matter and from the currents of spirituality, that she must go to extract evolutionary harmony. These two pitchers, represent the two poles of her fertility in matter. The pitcher of passivity is closer to her, representing the feminine principle of fertile action, a role more superior, than that of the masculine principle, being more susceptible than man, to be modelled for universal beauty. This pitcher touches the area around the genitalia, and its short waterfall, falling on sand, shows that it is physical receptivity, that communicates the instinctive vital currents of the individual, to matter (the ground) realized by divine intelligence. The active pitcher held in the right hand touches her knee, and the stream of the liquid it contains, flows onto the right foot. It is therefore a physical action, that produces an expansion in the emotional and sensitive plane, represented by the running of blue water.',\n",
       " 'In short, these pitchers and this water represents the great cosmic current, that never stops, always fertile and renewed. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The position of the woman, three-quarters to the left, shows there is a reflective tendency, that goes towards its realization, a state of passivity that becomes active. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The name THE STAR has been given to it, as a representation of the illuminating and redeeming force, symbolized by the stars, which provide a clarity that comes from infinity. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. A mental aid that provides a force to be used, but not directly, because you have to know how to use it. It is the inspiration of what to do. ANIMISTIC. It provides currents of balance and liveliness. PHYSICAL. Satisfaction, the love of humanity in all its beauty, the feeling of destiny, that animate men. Realizations of things, through order and harmony. In a matter concerning the arts, it gives idea of charm, that is, of radiance which attracts others. INVERTED.  Disharmony in destiny, physical harmony without duration. In short, in its elemental sense, THE STAR represents the celestial light, that makes man glimpse a dawn of peace, hope and beauty, to sustain him in his work, bringing him comforts in his struggles and guiding him through his vicissitudes, and without ever coming short, in his participation of cosmic harmonies.',\n",
       " \"THE MOON (La Lune) PRINCIPLE The tarot having been conceived, by reason of its evolutionary principles, according to the analogies derived from the number 10[28], the meaning of the 18th Arcanum must be deduced from the combination 10 + 8. Effectively, 10 implies the rest, that follows a completed cycle. 8, due to its indefinite description, represents an activity that is enclosed in itself, a double current that has neutralized, and these two numbers together express the paralysis, whose image is symbolized on this card by the darkness of the eclipse, in the mental plane, and on the animistic plane, by the rigidity of the towers and the encounter between the dogs, that oppose each other. Finally, on the physical plane, by the swamp. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card personifies THE INDIVISIBLE AND PERSISTENT LINK THAT JOINS THE PHYSICAL PLANE WITH THE ASTRAL PLANE; that is, with the plane of the invisible force, that rules the visible cosmos, and shows the distorted interpretations, that man introduces onto the coupled elements from these two planes. The two preceding cards indicated, one, the constructions of man, and two, the cosmic constructions of the Divine. Indeed, man has been endowed in his incarnation with very limited intelligence. He interprets the cosmic laws in his own way and distorts them. In this way, he is led to multiply, many times over, his own creations, to conceive them in the subtle planes, always wanting to give them a reality, that can only be illusory and that pull him further towards error. FEATURES BY ANALOGY In this card, the Moon, a symbol of man's imaginative creations, can only be a fleeting force, passing and not creative, not of divine origin, as evidenced by its human profile. The call of man to face his chimeras, and finding no point of support, but finding his own image like the reflection in a mirror. Yet it shows, by its rays, that surround it, that in its passing life, it still can exert an influence. That is why it also symbolizes the ebb and flow of human passions, as well as their reflections in the astral plane. Its colour is blue, a creation purely of the psyche, built by the spirit of man, almost independently of his will. The rays in red and blue, indicate that this astral body can influence the material plane and the religious plane, but with little force, because the white rays, show that they are almost neutralized. The tears falling to the ground mean, that what comes from the earth returns to the earth and that this creation of man in the astral plane, can fall back on to the earth and endow it with a moment of fertility. It is the ebb and flow of influence from the astral plane towards the terrestrial plane, and from the influence of the terrestrial towards the astral, both complete one another. These tears, droplets reversed, corroborate the scarce effectiveness of this body onto the earth, because what seems to fall like a fertilizing mana is, to the contrary, limited, and its red, yellow and blue colours, indicate, that man is not to expect to receive, necessarily, more support on the material plane, than on the spiritual plane or from the plane of intelligence. The yellow towers are the symbol of force and the creative and transitory nature of a dream, which, manages to form a monument, that seems stable, but is nothing more than an illusion. They represent persistence in error, the refuge that one has created to trap oneself in the illusion of it. The uneven ground shows that these towers seem, in the imaginations of man, to defy time, which he however from a base of honesty and solidity, cannot sustain. The flesh-coloured dogs symbolize man´s primitive instincts, originating in the mental torments, that besiege him and that enter into conflict with one another. They bark to the heavens, venting out their chimeras. They open their mouths to feed on fluids, but this food only accentuates their error. Dogs, as instruments of the subconscious, also indicate the instinctive feeling of the errors of the conscious mind. The crayfish, a voracious animal, with its claws, that pinch and embed, represents a state of purgatory, due to parasitic formations, that form in the state of the individual´s psyche, expressed by its blue colour, it is a purification of the lower psyche, that is experienced through suffering. The lake represents a deep pool, and the edge that surrounds it, means that, no matter how deep the fall, man, if he wants to rise to the surface, can find the necessary support by grabbing on to the edge. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE\",\n",
       " 'The figure on the moon is in profile, seen from the left, which indicates a tendency towards imagination, inactivity, suspension, the halt of things. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING This card is called THE MOON, that is, the chimera, because the moon, a light reflection of the sun, and not illuminated by itself, gives off an illusion, a mirage. It does not reflect reality, but rather manifests a borrowed life. It has no life of its own and makes the non-existent appear. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. In the case of conversations, lies. In cases of personal work, errors. Mirages on all planes. ANIMISTIC. Turbulent, passionate feelings, with no other outcome than disorder. Jealousy, hypochondria, chimerical ideas. PHYSICAL. Total obfuscation. Clouded and an active state of consciousness. Scandal, defamation, secrets revealed. If the question refers to health; there is disorder in the lymphatic system, you have to change your environment, which may lack hygiene, and put yourself in a dry place, in the sun. INVERTED. Instinct, the reasons for the mirage, the situation accentuates its effects, above the swamp. Confused state of consciousness however remaining latent, without action. In short, in its elementary sense, THE MOON represents the chimeric dreams of man, conceived in the dark, under the influence of the agitations of his soul, under the obsessive push of swampy desires, but releasing him from his personal torments, once he is made aware of their pointlessness.',\n",
       " \"THE SUN (Le Soleil) PRINCIPLE Along the same lines as the previous cards, the number 19 breaks down into 10 + 9. 10 represents the universal cycle and 9 the perfection, as if manifesting the product of 3 x 3, that is, the fusion of two ternaries one in the individual, and the other in the universal. A fusion that represents a complete harmony. 19 can also be considered to be a result of 9 + 9 + 1. The two 9s forming a new ternary adjusting the individual to the universal, no less complete than the preceding one, and 1 that of unity. This other aspect of perfection represents a starting over, but on a richer foundation. Due to its evolution, this cycle, this world, needs a change in the planes. The principle of the universal, by merging with that of the individual, makes matter vibrate. It lights up, takes autonomy, spreads its vibrations and radiates over its surroundings. This is why card XVIIII represents the concrete expression of this harmony with an image of the sun.        GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card THE TRIUMPH OF MAN OVER MATTER AND HIS EVOLUTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIVINE. It is opposed to the preceding card, that represented the action of man, separated, distant from that of the divine, while through its image of the sun, as its name indicates, shows the contribution of the divine, radiant and in beneficial form. It follows, that he grants the spirit a harmonious dominance over matter. FEATURES BY ANALOGY The sun is presented from the front, to show that its force is universal, and it does not have a side of light and another of shadow. It is represented with the face of man, thus indicating, that divine manifestation takes on the appearance of men. The rays alternate; triangles express perfect alignment, emanating from this astral body, and these flaming rays, with their devouring effects, exerted, thoroughly penetrating man situated under their radiance and by the divine force they represent. They are of all colours, expressing the universality of their harmony. The tears that fall from the sun, represented with the droplet pointed up, indicate a fruitful emanation, without loss, as in the Arcanum of the Moon, on the contrary, with a fullness, that is exalted in its downward approach. Their red, yellow and blue colours indicate, that they take their point of support on the material plane, on the spiritual plane and on the plane of intelligence. The two beings situated under the sun represent a perfect union of the spiritual and the material. Their sex is covered to show that their quality applies to both to the active and passive sides of man. The one who rests his hand on the other's shoulder marks the active principle, while his partner, who puts one hand on the centre of the body and holds the other back, shows that he stores and reserves. This arrangement highlights the balance, that exists between them, because they are a creation of the divine plane. Their flesh colour indicates that the action of the divine plane takes place on the vital plane. Their loin cloth highlights the demarcation between the high and the low, of the spiritual and the material, whose fusion has been indicated in the explanation of this card´s number. They are blue to show that in this representation, there are no high or low principles, but only a spiritual emanation. The small yellow wall, crowned with red, indicates the possibility of constructions in the physical, without obstruction, a possibility of realizing a harmonious, stable and solid construct. The ground is yellow, to show that their base is constituted by divine intelligence. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The pose of the sun´s face indicates its direct, full, frank action and coming from above. The two beings turned towards each other denote a balanced and harmonious activity, because of passivity on the left, and of activity on the right, turning towards each other, impregnating one another. They are the counterpart, in positivity, the positive versions of the two beings from the card THE DEVIL. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING\",\n",

       " 'THE JUDGMENT (Le Jugement) PRINCIPLE The number 20, that is 10 + 10, the number 10, a symbol of the universal cycle, repeating itself and because of this becomes polarized, expressing on one hand the individual and on the other the universal, but considered as 20, remains neutral, and expresses a state without activity, translating into stability. Man immobilized, looks at a cycle completed, one from 1 to 10, and the other, in the universal, from 10 to 20, and sets his goals to prepare for a new advance. He compares the knowledge gained with the debts owed, the conse-quences of his actions, and judges for himself in order to understand, whether the first phase of his evolution is over, which will lead him to the World, or if he will be forced to resume his career with the Fool. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card signifies THE INESCAPABLE CALL OF THE DIVINE AND THE SPIRITUAL PLAN IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, WHICH REQUIRES AN EXAMINATION, A REVIEW OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND THE EXPERIENCES GAINED. FEATURES BY ANALOGY In the symbolic interpretation of the figures and the details on this card, the angel represents the divine part, which man has left on the divine plane, when he incarnated into matter. The angel is represented by a human figure, because during man´s incarnation, he needs to see himself again and reflect on his true image. The two wings, flesh-coloured, show that what man has momentarily abandoned, he can now approach, and the angel’s arms, red, indicate that this part of the divine, he can take with him into the material, although it may have been clouded over and been shipwrecked. The angel´s yellow hair indicates, that man is essentially a part of divine intelligence, but that this part he cannot bring with him into the material world. He is surrounded by blue clouds, because often man loses sight of the spiritual traits within, hidden to him, but these clouds can dissipate and he will see his own divinity rise again, with his spirituality and intelligence. The trumpet indicates that man has always been able to hear the voice that calls him. It also symbolizes the vibrations that awaken his sleeping consciousness, to make him see the fruits of his actions and their inevitable consequences. The rays, by means of their yellow, and their red, denote that the divine intellectual part of man, even when not incarnated, mirror his incarnations, from to which he cannot be indifferent by reason of the bond that ties them to him. The absence of blue comes from the fact, that the angel, being of the divine, does not need to display spirituality. The flag, white with a yellow cross, symbolizes the abstract nature of the divine plane, intangible to us (white), and which cannot be accessed without the spirit (the yellow) of sacrifice (the cross). This access is inevitable, because the divine plane is a devouring flame, that makes the incarnations of man move towards it, as the flag attached to the trumpet testifies, meaning, the emissions of the vibrations that awakens man and calls him towards the divine. The two figures in front represent humanity, masculine and feminine, and their state of consciousness is symbolized by a third person, they are observing. He turns his back, thus pointing out that his state of consciousness is hidden. He is watching the angel, who is only known on the divine plane. He also represents the state of consciousness that allows man to find again, that which he left behind, when returning to source, and what will make it possible for him to incarnate again. The demeanour of the two figures facing each other indicates, that to know your own state of consciousness, you have to abstract yourself and observe yourself in a mirror. The hair of all three, is blue, to specify that matter can only evolve when a ray of spirituality has touched it. These three figures are not only representing man, but the awakening of most of the material plane, symbolized by the grave, in past acts carried out in the three planes; physical, animistic and mental. These forces also adapt to everything that lives on Earth, because when the state of consciousness is animated, everything that lives within it approaches their creator. They are only three, and not a multitude of men, to indicate that consciousness only reveals itself to the life of an individual and not to us collectively. The tomb is green, to indicate that the grave, the image of death, is not sterile, but is a great fertile force. The ground is yellow and the figures do not emerge from it. Only slowly and with the help of divine intelligence will man emerge from the depths of his material state. The difficulties in this task are symbolized by the uneven state of the soil. This card follows the Sun, to show that man has taken his origins in the vibrations of the force of the divine, but cannot harmoniously manifest them, if not through a succession of earthly returns. Although he remains in contact with the heavens through the divine part in him, there is a part of him that suffers, that belongs to incarnation, because if he is an integral part of God, he is also an integral part of the material cosmos. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The position of the figures, the immobility, seen from behind, implies detention and inaction. Two of them turn a quarter, the woman on the right and the man on the left, they show the opposite orientation of activity vs passivity, which, on this card, leads them to detention, as they look at the figure seen from behind. The angel falls forward, his action is exerted by his trumpet, to animate the activity of the lower world towards the spiritual. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The name THE JUDGMENT has been given to this card, not in the sense of justice, but in the sense of comparison and evaluation of man by himself and on his own. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. The call of man towards a higher state, his tendencies and his desires for elevation. ANIMISTIC. No animistic radiance. PHYSICAL. Good card, work of inventory, compilation, classification. Stability in a good or bad situation. Health and balance INVERTED. Error made by oneself, and above all sufferings from an erroneous judgment. In short, in its elementary sense, THE JUDGMENT represents man, awakened from his sleep in the material by his divine aspect, which forces him to examine his soul in all its nakedness, and to judge it.',\n",

       " 'THE WORLD (Le Monde) PRINCIPLE Among the different combinations of the number 21 likely to agree with this card, the arrangement 20 + 1 and not 7 x 3 prevails, because the Tarot, when representing the evolution of man, must take its departure from the second series of ten, as it was done in the first. 3 x 7 = 21, which has been adopted by some Tarot interpreters, can only be accepted by subordinating oneself to a very secondary point of view, because this combination represents successive cycles of activity, that would be inclined to repeat themselves by ternary series and would no longer coincide with the Major Arcana of the Tarot, which have been extended to 22. 20 + 1 = 21 represents, by 20, a rich passivity with an activity 1, purposefully indicated by the central figure, whose raised leg indicates the activity of 1, and the androgyny; the agreement between the passivity of the 20 and this activity. GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card means THE PSYCHIC AND SPIRITUAL ILLUMINATION IN A HARMONY MANIFESTED BY THE CLEARLY VISIBLE BALANCE IN THE ELEMENTAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THIS CARD. It symbolizes the perfection of man in the universal, his triumph over matter, his power over nature. It follows the Judgment, which gave man the means to reach the peak of his evolution, forcing him to listen to the call of the divine and to make a course alteration after each incarnation in matter. In a more general sense, it also symbolizes the perfect equilibrium of the worlds. FEATURES BY ANALOGY The central figure is androgynous. The two sexes united in one, without the ability to determine, which one of them dominates. In any event, this means, that the two poles are equivalent, always preserving their own superiority and the independence of their will. This figure sexuality is covered because, in reaching its apogee, man no longer reincarnates and therefore no longer procreates. This is indicated by the fine shawl thrown lightly over it and not by cloth, which would imply a desire to conceal. Its left leg is bent to indicate, that it is active and not immovable. Its right foot, perched on a support that rests on the two poles of the wreath and not on the centre knot, shows, that it walks on a support based on it, and by the yellow coming from an intelligent manifestation. In its left hand, it holds a wand, that signals its power over nature. In its right hand, it holds only just with two fingers, an oval-shaped container representing a filter. It is the creative filter of illusion on all planes of nature, because man can have both the illusion of love and spirituality. The filter is in opposition to the wand, meaning that the illusion created by man can give him a fleeting sense of royalty, but that everywhere, in the world of illusions and in the real world, as well as in the spiritual, man instead possesses a royalty, he conserves from his divine essence. The wreath surrounding the figure represents the double radiation of the universal towards man and of man towards the universal. In the first, it means the currents of cosmic fluids, that maintain it, and in the second, the manifestation of the perfect aura realized by man on the three planes; red (evolved matter), yellow (divine intelligence), blue (spiritual mysticism). Blue is below to indicate that man, freed from the slavery of his flesh, is now completely in spirituality, and red, located between yellow and blue, in the centre, shows that matter regains his place between spirituality and divine intelligence. The red knots, above and below, welds these two poles together. The four figures manifest the quaternary of superior forces, stabilized and balanced, in matter. This balance is the result of the four corner positions, which indicate that man has achieved full possession of his inner forces. The eagle represents the wisdom of the heavens; meaning, the spiritual hovering over all creation. Its penetration into the depths of matter is symbolized by its red halo, and its action on all planes, which interpenetrate, through its body made of yellow feathers and feathered wings in blue[29]. The heavens, on which it takes its support, symbolized by the cloud, consists of the subtle and non-concrete elements, drawn in white, as with the spirituality created by man. The being, above and to the left, depicts a human figure to evoke its ties with humanity. His red wings[30] mean man cannot reach that state of supreme perfection, without having passed through matter and having been taken out of it again. His blue arms symbolize acts done exclusively in the domain of high spirituality. The front of the blue garment[31], white on one side and shaded on the other, represents the spiritual acts of man, some manifest, the other dark, obscured, unknown, can have great reach as well. The bull, flesh-coloured, is the symbol of the generating power of the physical plane. It has no halo, because being essentially in matter, it is the brutal and undiscerning regenerator. Its wings mean that its symbolic potency extends to all life forms and to all worlds. The lion, yellow in colour[32], is the symbol of the intelligent force, that presides over this universal fertilization, and that, as with the bull in flesh, is not the human material passions represented by the red colour of the other cards, but the worlds in matter, the concretization of divine thought. Its flesh-coloured halo shows that this intelligent force radiates onto the physical plane. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE All are facing ahead, with their head to the left, except the eagle who is in profile to the right, implying a strong direct activity, but with reflection, finding inspiration before the flight. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING This card has the name THE WORLD, because being at the top of the Major Arcana, harmoniously makes concrete the efforts of evolution, indicated by the preceding cards. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES In a spread, this card means the feminine element, it cannot be interpreted or adapted to the masculine. It is a very individual card. If the querent is a man, it represents his thoughts, not his individuality. If it is a woman, it represents her personality rather than her thoughts. MENTAL. Great power on this plane. Tendency towards perfection. Mental and control of the psyche. ANIMISTIC. It conserves its power on this plane and means the elevation of spirit, feelings of altruistic love, meaning, neither egotistical nor sensual (an androgynous being represented on this card). Love of humanity. Tendency towards perfection. Inspiration in artists. PHYSICAL. On this plane, to which it adapts with difficulty, it loses most of its power. Rich experiences. Solid and radiant affairs. Success and worldliness. Good health.',\n",

       " \"THE FOOL (Le Mat) PRINCIPLE This card is not specified by any number, because it would be necessary to give it the number 0 or 22. It cannot be 0, without the Fool then representing the universal indefinite, being mobile he is only but one step in evolution. Neither can he be described with 22; that is, by two passivities, as this implies an inaction, which is absolutely contrary to the appearance of the figure depicted on this card.[33] GENERAL AND ABSTRACT MEANING This card represents THE INESCAPABLE MARCH OF MAN TOWARDS EVOLUTION. Having not yet learned all the lessons of card XX and consequently, not yet reached the apogee of his evolution, man must thus walk his path through successive lives as a vagabond, indifferent of what tomorrow brings, his destiny hidden from him, because the advance constitutes the hope of an ever-better life, which requires of him to travel the long path of incarnation. This card is normally placed at the end of the arcana, although strictly speaking it can follow any other multiples of 7; meaning after the Chariot (1 x 7) or Temperance (2 x 7), given its evolutionary qualities. Although the Fool is found at the end of the deck, it does not indicate a confusing conclusion. It does not represent man, who has the book of all human possibilities, on everything that is guided towards him, of all the paths he must sever, of his burdens, and lead him to discouragement. On the contrary, it shows the return, at each birth with the amnesia of what he has been, and with the ignorance of what he will become. It is this languishment that allows him to open with a card that engenders a conclusion, not of his destiny but of the preceding 21 arcana. When man has reached his apogee, this card will disappear and the conclusion will be given in Arcanum XXI. The Fool also represents a link between the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana, the latter describing man in his activities. FEATURES BY ANALOGY The stick that supports the bundle has two fixed rings, which prevent it from being withdrawn, indicating it is being imposed on man. It also means, that man is prevented in settling on any part of his path. This bundle is flesh-coloured to indicate, that man must always carry with him the inheritance of his fall onto the physical plane, because everything that comes into contact with physical life is a fall. Conversely it is his hope, a kind of Pandora's box that he cannot open but he can rely on, nonetheless. It contains his illusions and past experiences. The stick is white, meaning, neutral, to show that the bundle has not been created by himself. The yellow cane, in his right hand, when in support of the ground, puts him in contact with the physical world and shows, that through his intelligence, he draws strength from the same roots that gave him birth on Earth. The angle of flesh visible in the breeches of the figure, and on which the dog hassles, is the lowest part of man, the part representing the animal, that remains in him. It appears bare, because despite the habits, that he has created for himself in the course of evolution, he cannot get rid of it. The dog also signifies a remnant of the mistakes of the past, that persist in man in his march forward. This dog also symbolizes a lower plane of life, that tends to evolve and follow man. Likewise, it means that man has risen above the animal plane, not forgetting that, in his march towards his evolution, his fall has placed him among the ranks of lower creatures and that in his march, he must bring evolution amidst. His yellow cap, with a red pompom, signifies the intelligence, that man must clothe himself with in order to travel his way through the material world. The red tip implies a material intelligence, not of the divine. The blue ruff, the points of which end in bells, shows that the man in his footsteps is confused by the rumours of his past incarnations, and the noise it causes on earth, prevents him from finding his divine memories and forces him to walk. There are bells attached to both the belt and the ends of the blue ruff, to indicate that he is bewildered both on the material and spiritual plane. The blue arm, coming out of the yellow sleeve, means that man, has the ability for intelligent thoughts (yellow cap) and can perform intelligent actions, but these will not be effective, if he does not know how to ground them with spirituality. Since man advances in the material world of his successive incarnations, he only does so through spirituality, as indicated by the blue tights and red shoes. Though man walks like a vagabond through the walks of life, he is intelligence still, he is directed by divine intelligence indicated by the yellow of the soil and in order to show the difficulties of life, uneven ground. The tufts of grass signify active fertility, some are green, symbolizing fertilization on the physical plane, referring to the passage of the vagabond through incarnations. Others are white, symbolizing the fertilization, that he performs on the spiritual plane, during his disincarnations and consequently they are invisible in the physical plane. ORIENTATION OF THE FIGURE The Fool walks from left to right, but his head is turned three-quarters, implying the search for an activity, the reflection before acting and bringing about his evolution. PARTICULAR AND CONCRETE MEANING The name LE MAT (THE FOOL), which has been given to him, has the same meaning given to mate in Chess, (échec et mat is French for Checkmate), that is to say cornered. Indeed, he is overwhelmed by his burdens, which he cannot put down, pushed by the dog, stimulated by his bells, restless by the worries of the road, the obligation to move forward and the urgency of circumstances, that he will encounter on his path. He is also carefree in the sense that he is not aware of the obstacles of life and must deal with them as they come. UTILITARIAN MEANINGS IN THE THREE PLANES MENTAL. Indetermination due to the multiplicity of concerns that arise, and of which there is only partial awareness. Ideas in the process of transforming. Dubious advice. ANIMISTIC. Turbulence in feelings, uncertainty in endeavours, vulgar feelings without duration. PHYSICAL. Unawareness, lack of order, forgetting promises, insecurity, departure or displacement. Voluntary abandonment of material goods. Lack of visibility in affairs. From the point of view of health; lymphatism, swelling, abscess. INVERTED.  The Fool, a figure in movement, indicates that he has fallen or that he has been stopped in his path. Forced abandonment of material goods and fall without return or hope. Complications, entanglements, incoherence.\",\n",

       " 'GENERAL COMMENTS ON THE MINOR ARCANA The Minor Arcana represent the secondary forces, that are subordinate to the principles expressed by the Major Arcana. They allow the implications, that lead to realities to be manifested, and are the steps between principle forces and their practical application. They make the Major Arcana concrete. To put it briefly, the Minor Arcana give the details, that are derived from the principles expressed by the Major Arcana, however as one does not live in the energy of principle forces, it is necessary to express the implications of these in practical terms. Like their seniors, they are subject to the laws of numbers. As they represent a material idea, they emit simpler expressions, therefore simpler images, and that is why their total number is higher than that of the others. They are 56 vs. 22, because as their quality is applied to the combinations in matter, they are necessarily grouped into series of four. 4 being the number representative of work in the material. These series have been given the following names: Swords, Cups, Coins and Clubs. Moreover, as the Tarot represents the evolution of man, symbolized by the cycles of 10[34], and 10 implying all the periodic elements of the physical world, each element of the quaternary of the Minor Arcana, each with 10 repetitions, express all possible combinations of numbers in the physical world. These combinations, being inconclusive by themselves, need to be defined through a new quaternary made conscious. 4 new figures result from this, which are naturally doubly polarized, namely; the Page and the Knight, the Queen and the King[35]. The basic quaternary visualized in this synthesis, with the objective to make concrete the Major Arcana, is extrapolated further into two groups of polarities. The first, active and quantitative, represents an expansive energy and a condensing of energy, of which the Ancients have made the principles of fire and that of earth, and which, according to the symbolic images of the Minor Arcana, correspond to the Clubs and to the Coins, respectively. The second, passive and qualitative, represents sensitive states, one expansive the other receptive, of which the Ancients have made the principle of Air and Water, and which correspond to the Swords and to the Cups, respectively. This same quaternary, from an analytical point of view, makes this stand out as a form of condensation of forces; Fire, Air, Water and Earth, corresponding to the Minor Arcana; the Clubs, the Swords, the Cups and the Coins.[36]   This combination of the synthetic and analytical view of the quaternary provide the following general meanings: The SWORDS represent the activity on the material plane, which in its most subtle and extended expression, opens an access to the spiritual riches of divine love. The CUPS, a symbol of the receptive sensitivity of man, is filled with these spiritual riches and expresses them through a psyche that extends from the highest to the most elemental; from divine love to human affection. The COINS concretize the riches by extending them to all the domains of the Earth, through the works of intelligence. The CLUBS, symbol of material strength, use these riches to build, to cultivate and to consume. The SWORDS represent activity on the material plane which, in its most subtle and most broad expression, creates access to the spiritual riches of divine love. Regardless of their particular suits, each of these four aspects of the Minor Arcana are reflected in the other three; thus, the notion of universal love is found in all four, but is dominant in the Swords, as it represents sacrifice. To more easily understand the sequential evolution, meaning, the tendency and the efforts towards a higher purpose of the four modalities represented by the Swords, the Cups, the Clubs and the Coins, it is useful to compare the previous card and the following card, not in the order of the numbers, but in the order of parities, that is, those corresponding to the same polarization. The even or passive cards are lumped together, and the odd or active cards likewise, the former produces the internal work and verifies energy reserves, and the latter acting externally while making those reserves bear fruit by putting their activity into play.',\n",

       " 'REPRESENTATION OF THE NUMBERS ON THE MINOR ARCANA The number of objects that appear on each Minor Arcana from 2 to 10, with the exception of the Coins, is indicated on the mid-horizontal axis, to the right and to the left, expressing the duality and thus indicating that these cards are passive -therefore impersonal and inoperative by themselves-, which implies a possible signal, a subordination to the majors, and which do nothing but contribute a property that the other cards direct. Its role is overshadowed by the Major Arcana, and this significance is further accentuated by the Coins. These, in fact, do not carry any number – representing the circle with neither beginning nor end, and can therefore be adapted to all creations, just as money can be used for all of man´s endeavours. These four series of Minor Arcana, except for the Aces, are represented along two axes of symmetry, one vertical and the other horizontal. The first, characterizes the activity. The second, the passive significance, into two parts, separating the High from the Low - the Spiritual from the Material -, appearing frequently to make distinctions between elements of the card. The Minor Arcana Courts, which, due to their human representation, indicate a personality, have names affirming this, consequently their predominance over the other Minor Arcana. The Aces do not display a number, because they represent a synthesis of the series of cards to which they are applied, and consequently, they cannot take shape mid-air. However, by applying the number of the subsequent card, the unity onto another plane is transposed, this then reveals the original quality of the card.',\n",

       " 'General Comments on the Numbers 1–10 And Modalities by which the Symbolism of The Numbers have been derived for their adaptation to the Minor Arcana[37] 1 The Ace represents unity, considered as an embarkation and as a synthesis summarizing the significance of the 9 consecutive cards of the same suit. 2 The number 2 is the symbol of passivity, polarity and the quality of gestation. Through passive polarity, it has no effect, but through gestation, it represents the substance in all growth. 3 The number 3, through 2 + 1, introduces an activity in the passivity of 2, which gives a direction to the gestation. 4 The number 4, a product of 2 x 2, contains a crystallization and, as the intermediary between 3 and 5, a transition. It represents therefore relative stability, and consequently, things which are ordered and with a direction towards consolidation, towards security. 5 The number 5 is a number of transition, of passage, from one plane to another, because it is comprised of 4 + 1, with 4 being a complete number, to which unity is added, meaning, a beginning. The base of 4, on which it leans to generate the next number, gives it a sense of multiplicity and diffusion by radiance. 6 The number 6 represents a harmonious balance, being made up of 3 + 3; that is, two ternaries that are opposed to each other and of 2 x 3, implying the simultaneity of these two ternaries, and consequently, their equilibrium. In its elemental sense, it means a latent power, a potential, reserves from which one can extract. 7 The number 7 = 6 + 1, indicates, through unity, a force, and the action that uses the power contained in the 6. It puts it into play, maintaining its harmony, so that it meets a successful end. This is a number of synthetic performance. 8 The number 8 (= 4 + 4), joins the combination of the cross and the square; that is, the stability of the material plane with the inner life of the divine plane. It is a balance, that is not abstract, like that of 6, but that marks an end, because it does not need to be animated by other currents. It is the symbol of infinity, as formed by two linked circles, which, traveling in the same direction, develop one through the other indefinitely.  9 The number 9 represents the orientation of the abstract towards the concrete. The first 8 numbers indicated, matter was animated by the divine. Creating 9, which is 8 + 1, forces 8, which is perfect, to take one more unit; meaning, an entry into action, to describe a new cycle, implying a new penetration of force into the material, such as what takes place when a virtually conceived universe is manifested in the material, in order to create one´s evolutionary experiences. 10 While 1 synthesizes on its principles the other numbers from where things begin, 10 condenses them within itself, because it participates in each of them through its 0. This brings them together in potential and directs them to a new cycle, through 1 which accompanies the 0. It is, further-more, the number of reason and of calm, since, while with 9, the abstract is making contact with the concrete, by 10, it is now in equilibrium in the physical, since 10 = 2 x 5. CONCLUSION The Minor Arcana stop at the number 10, because if they surpass this number and reach 12, which is a result, they would no longer have a link with the physical and that would be inaccessible to human understanding.',\n",

       " 'INTRODUCTION TO THE COURT CARDS OF THE MINOR ARCANA The courts of the Minor Arcana are designed to synthesize the polarity of the numbers in activity and passivity, indicated by odd and even numbers, respectively. On the one hand, they are represented by Knights and Kings, and on the other, by Pages and Queens. Human representation has been used to indicate a higher plane than that of numbers, a plane on which responsibility and freedom takes place in acts. More abstractly, it can be said that the courts symbolize a synthesis of the qualities of the numbers on a higher plane than that of the four Aces, and that they are an adaptation of unity - the principle of the ten numbers - to the Universal, where man stands. The conscious quaternary, formed by the figures, implies a terrestrial value and an evolutionary value, the first symbolizing the state of man in the physical world, and the second, his need to detach himself from the material to evolve. This is indicated by the quaternary of the Pages, which is different than that of the Knights, which in turn differs from that of the Queens, like the latter from that of the Kings. These figures are characterized as follows: THE PAGE, in its elevated state, is a starting point that represents consciousness, not quite come to life and locked in the immobility of 4, so it is conscious chaos, ready to act, however a potential under pressure. He is also an announcer, and his dress and attributes symbolizes the properties of the announcement. More elementally, it indicates potentiality and prepares for its execution, without having enough strength to act, due to its passivity. The four Pages denote an internal work, since they all indicate passivity, but the internal in the proper meaning of each card. This stands out by the emphasis of its symbol, because each Page is represented in turn by a very long sword, a massive club, a very elongated cup, and by two coins, when no other figure has a double symbol. THE KNIGHT is this chaos coming out of its immobility under the effects of an evolutionary blow. The figure is on horseback and not on foot, thus showing that the principle of the Page has been carried forth to his evolution. It follows then he is not his own master, he cannot lead his horse, if he is not in balance. In the elemental order, he is essentially active. He transmits and acts, following the directives of the Page. To perfect this evolution, the Knight must reach THE QUEEN, who represents spiritualized passivity, as well as wisdom and temperance, because the feminine principle, due to its passivity, keeps the tranquillity and the equilibrium necessary to receive wisdom. A fertilizing principle, therefore creative, and that in its elementary sense, illuminates the contributions of the Knight. The three preceding figures allow for final realization of THE KING, the principle of strength and power, which results from the fusion of the passive element; the Queen, and the active element; the Knight. The King represents domination on all planes, on the cosmic plane, for example, over the elements. In his elementary principle, he is a conductor. The Minor Arcana courts constitute a mixed bag, between Universal laws, which this quaternary obeys, and the laws of matter, which they direct. These cards are therefore placed last, as they are intermediators. The tarot is then three series all relating to the combinations of numbers; the first, formed by the Major Arcana, represents the action of the Universal through the combinations of numbers; the second, formed by the Minor Arcana from 1 to 10, indicate the combinations of the numbers in themselves, and the third, formed by the Minor Arcana Courts, indicate the reactions of man on the combinations of numbers.',\n",
